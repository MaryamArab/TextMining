JAPANESE ECONOMIST SEES STABLE YEN/DOLLAR RATES|The yen should stabilize at around 152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar for about a year, the Bank of Tokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said. "Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of the year," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia. Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election. The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar. REUTER

INDIAN BUDGET COMES IN FOR WIDE CRITICISM|Opposition politicians, businessmen and newspapers criticised India"s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees. They said the budget failed to provide incentives for economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform. But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a vote winner. The Indian Express, the country"s biggest selling paper, said: "The defence cow has never been holier." The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget "shamelessly political." It said in a front page commentary the "budget is bad for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and neutral in respect of everything else." Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done little for them. Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries. Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago. Reaction in Bombay, India"s business capital, was generally unfavourable. Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan. Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income. Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India"s biggest, fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi"s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry. The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times. Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales. Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital gains tax. Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come. REUTER

EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY|European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis." But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes. Reuter

EC OPENS ANTI-DUMPING ENQUIRY INTO SOVIET MERCURY|The European Community Commission said it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices. The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry. According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace. The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said. The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs. The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the Commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority. REUTER
INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW|Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia"s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks. "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain," the report says. "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels." Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump. REUTER

SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT|Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance." Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market." Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement. "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said. Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing. REUTER

The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received in London, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into Iraq on January 9 was now over. It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had "dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the history of the Iraq-imposed war." The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in southern Iraq. "The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance power of its army...," said the statement quoted by IRNA. It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of Baghdad to "come to their senses" and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in Iraq. Iran said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into Basra. The Iranian forces "are in full control of these areas," the statement said. It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally destroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. The victory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti- aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Reuter
ESTIMATED DROP IN JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS TRIMMED|The combined profits of Japan's major corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research Institute of Economics said. The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November. Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said. Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook, the institute said. It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved performance outlook. Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses, it said. The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88. REUTER

WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE|Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match <SMBS ST>, one of the companies at the core of their business empire. A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier <NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo <VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco <ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>. Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB <SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB <ALFS ST>. During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB <ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.

ICI <ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES|Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson. "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not." ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits. "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin, a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc <MRK>, is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive." Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS|Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had "clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region." In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said. REUTER
FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY|Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to today." Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous." "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein." "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing." Reuter

INDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION|Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal 1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty, economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters. The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is 56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. Economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he said. But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously. They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party, said Gandhi's failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects, after bad weather last year, may strain prices further. Economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes, which will discourage savings, economists said. Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. Brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three. Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, "There is uncertainty in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure." But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene. "Just now there is acute nervousness in the market," he said. Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market on a long-term basis. New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

UNILEVER IMPROVES IN MOST SECTORS DURING 1986|The Unilever Plc and NV <UN.A> group saw improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement. Very good progress was made last year, while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc <CBM.N> was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come. Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year. Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987. Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal, though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers added. REUTER

EARTHQUAKES CONTINUE TO SHAKE NORTHERN NEW ZEALAND|Earthquakes and aftershocks are still shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless. Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT). No casualties have been reported and no further major damage, civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock. A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes. Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km, the seismologist added. A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared yesterday and is still in force, with schools closed and access to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe, Whakatane and the forestry town of Kawerau severely restricted. Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale. The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out. Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides in the area are being cleared, with power and water restored to most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being repaired. Prime Minister David Lange visited the region today before flying to Auckland to attend a South Pacific Forum conference of foreign ministers. A small force of troops was moved into the area to assist civil defence workers and volunteers. Civil defence sources said people would shortly begin to return to their homes when the buildings are declared safe. REUTER

TECHNOLOGY/CHIP INDUSTRY SEEKS CUSTOM DESIGNS|U.S. semiconductor manufacturers, struggling to stem a river of red ink, are increasingly looking toward customized designs rather than mass-market chips for future profits. The market for customized chips - semiconductors designed for a very specific application or product - is expected to expand by 25 to 30 pct this year, compared with only about six pct for the entire integrated circuit industry. Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimates that sales of customized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last year, about 12 pct of the total chip market. By 1990, however, customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15 billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales. More important for their vendors, because they are not a standard design customized chips represent a sellers' market, and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly. High volume memory chips have become "a perfect commodity market," Robert Brodersen, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, told an industry forum. "The product is interchangeable between one manufacturer and another and customers base their buying decisions almost entirely on price," Brodersen said. He predicted that, in the next few years, only a handful of the world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them Japanese) will produce memory chips, the standard electronic component found in everything from digital watches to computers. "The rest of the industry just won't be involved." Last week's International Solid State Circuits Conference, the chip industry's annual forum for new developments, seemed to support Brodersen's prediction. Of the 116 papers presented at the conference, some 40 pct had Japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd the United States. Most of the Japanese chip designs were in the memory category, including Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co's attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory (dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything now available. The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. company was International Business Machine Corp's <IBM> four mln bit chip, and IBM only manufactures chips for its own internal use, not for the open market. The problem with memory chips is that they are all based on the same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy and inexpensive to manufacture. Because such large Japanese conglomerates as Sony Corp <SNE>, NEC Corp, <NIPNY> Matushita and Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics product lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for their chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low cost per unit. Customized chips, however, are designed for a specific customer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive relative to standard chips. Computer markets are increasingly looking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy, thus making the final product harder to clone as well. Intel Corp <INTC>, the leading manufacturer of the microprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted the industry to its intention to switch to customized chips last fall. The company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it will spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself into a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips. Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a piece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage that the others do not. IBM, which owns a 20 pct stake in Intel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000 chips it makes for its own use. Intel will customize those designs and sell them to others. It will also get to use IBM's proprietary computer system for designing chips, considered by experts to be one of the most advanced in the world. Intel's success is still not guaranteed, however. Industry analysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market item than a customized chip that requires a close working relationship with the customer. Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its newest 30386 microprocessor. A much faster turnarouond time, and much lower development costs, will be required for customized chips if the firm is to succeed. Reuter
AMC <AMO> SAYS STEPS TAKEN AFTER UAW TALKS FAIL|American Motors Corp said it will take steps to build a proposed new jeep vehicle at an unspecified "alternative location" after the weekend breakdown of talks with the United Automobile Workers union on a concessionary contract covering workers at AMC's Wisconsin operations. AMC spokesman Lloyd Northard told Reuters that the company will not build its new Jeep ZJ sports utility vehicle at its Kenosha, Wisc., assembly plant as a result of the talks' failure. "We sincerely regret this outcome, but the responsibility for it rests entirely with the local union bargaining committees," the company said in a statement. "We will, therefore, initiate the actions necessary to place the new Jeep product in an alternative location rather than at Kenosha." UAW officials said during the weekend they did not regard the collapse of talks as final after the company's "final" proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by union bargainers. But AMC said the union's rejection of its concessions package means that plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee will lose 6,500 jobs because the assembly complex in Kenosha "will not be getting new work" as had been proposed with a new contract. "This unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining existing working and bringing new work to existing U.S. operations," AMC said. Asked if the company considered the decision to phase out the Kenosa plant by 1989 as previously detailed to be final, Northard said: "If the union came to us and said they would accept our final proposal, that's another matter." But the company charged bargainers for UAW Locals 72 and 75 had reneged on commitments for a new agreement with lower labor rates made in 1985 when the union locals negotiated a concessionary agreement covering AMC's Wisconsin operations. AMC, which last week reported its first profitable quarter in two years, said it wanted a contract for the plants with labor rates and work rules comparable to agreements between the UAW and Japanese automakers operating in the U.S. Wall Street investors reacted to the AMC-UAW impasse by driving down AMC's stock price. In active trading, AMC was off 3/8 to 3-1/2, a 9.7 pct decline since Friday's close. Reuter

U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION|All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said. The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said. Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim Miller, president of NAWG said. "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said. Reuter

STRONG EARTHQUAKE HITS NEW ZEALAND|An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas, officials and seismologists said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas. The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually isolated. A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which has about 16,000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges in the area had been damaged. No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud slip. Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes, the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were followed by a series of aftershocks. The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions in the northeast of the North Island. Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more than a week. Police said many districts lost power supplies and telephone links. Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam, 32 kilometres above Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river. The quake cracked the roadway and concrete abutment along the top of Matahina, the largest earth dam in the North Island. REUTER

QUEBECOR <PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY|Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview. The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company <Donohue Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said. "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This is not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that he plans to announce a decision early next week. Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the second-largest circulation paper in Canada. A new daily would give Montreal its second English- language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North America, analysts have said. Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new venture would have the support of major advertisers. Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55 pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project but has not decided whether he would take partners in the newspaper venture. He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures. "It would be the possibility of doing something else in the short term," Peladeau said. Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc <BPCL.L> does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects. Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British printing acquiring the other 49 pct. "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to print the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said to myself...next time we'll be ready." Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint capacity however, is already committed to other buyers. Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes. Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49 pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's 540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build another mill to meet their demands . He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the government. Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire. He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in France or the U.S. Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada, Peladeau said. He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province. Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock Exchange listing. Reuter

VERSATILE TO BUILD POLAR ICE BREAKER|Versatile Corp's shipbuilding subsidiary has a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie said. In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded. The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel. said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work." Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of direct employment. Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and completed in 1992. The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the journey, claiming the area was an international water way. The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic. Reuter

ARGENTINA COULD SUSPEND DEBT PAYMENTS - DEPUTY|Argentina could suspend payments on its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station. "Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth of the country," he added. Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks, told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the banks were divided on the loan request. Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day of talks had been postponed. He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt. Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in 1987, Baglini said. "Debtor nations should not have to take from their own pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest payments," he added. Reuter

NEUTRAL BUDGET EXPECTED IN SINGAPORE|Singapore's Finance Minister Richard Hu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with no major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1, bankers and economists told Reuters. They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work. Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct, and income tax was reduced by the same margin. Last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct. "I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving," said Clemente Escano, vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland. The government's economic report for calendar 1986, issued last week, said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986. But the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property. The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned consumption tax in the coming financial year. In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use. The sources said the government does not look likely to raise more revenue in this year's budget. Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion. Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure, helped by the wage-freeze policy. Anthony K.P. Lee, vice-president and deputy general manager of American Express Bank Ltd, said he expected nothing exciting from this year's budget. Lee said, "It will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already started moving so it does not need government support." Last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget, economists said. The economic report said the sector's activity declined by 25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. A further decline is expected in 1987. But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988, so the most Hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts. The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are incentives to encourage population growth, including incentives to families who have three children. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announced the government will try to encourage three-child families, instead of the two-child families it encourages now. REUTER
SINGAPORE EXCHANGE SEEKING NASDAQ/LONDON LINK|The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System, banking sources said. The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York authorities. Gordon Macklin, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers in Washington, said he was very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end of this month. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local financial support for the plan existed. Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore filling a gap when no trading takes place. A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start of three-centre trading to determine investor interest. The Singapore, London and New York authorities have agreed in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and transfer information among the different time zones, but some details still have to be worked out, a senior Singapore bank director said. Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market liquidity and communication links to the other three centres. But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a head start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong, Toyko and Australia, he said. On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ), modelled on NASDAQ. At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one company, the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd (SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small firms have said they plan to seek listings soon. Market sources expect the next few companies listed will also be government-owned entities, which would have no problem meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon, they said. SNP, previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd, issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times. In SESDAQ trading, SNP shares have advanced from an initial 1.87 dlrs to a Friday close of 2.32 after a 2.80 high. So far more than 900,000 shares have traded. REUTER

JAPANESE FINANCIAL FUTURES PLAN REVEALED|The Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan released its proposal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo. The market should include a comprehensive range of futures and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is available, the proposal said. It should provide currency and interest rate futures, and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts. The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments. To make this possible, the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework. Banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit, three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's financial markets. Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective market participants to banks but was willing to accept those from wider business circles, the sources said. Japan's only current financial futures market, in yen bonds, began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985. But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading in a basket of leading stocks in April. REUTER

JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS|The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness. A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters. Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said. But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak. U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement. Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure." MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said. But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money," a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said. REUTER

BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES|Thailand's improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said. Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier. Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the <Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise. Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said. A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985. Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached. Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports. REUTER

CHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987|Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split. The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue. Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985. Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985. Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies. "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings." Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.

JAPAN SALES TAX MAY FORCE NAKASONE OUT OF OFFICE|Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely to leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said. They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988. "Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration, which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori, professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters. "Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer," Shiratori said. Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax. "There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies," he told a meeting of government and party leaders. "If the party discipline is broken, I would like to see punishment considered." "A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it," Shiratori said. "Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging," he said. Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April, involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP, the political analysts added. Shiratori said, "In the worst case, implementation of the sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision. "Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct. "A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs," he said. Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University, thought the last possibility most likely. "I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills," he said. The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House. To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign, Sato said. "Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed," he said. REUTER

U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS|U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been "acting a bit strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks. Reuter

COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS|This morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said. "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said. "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said. "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added. Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis. "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said. "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation," de Vries added. With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

GERMAN EUROBOND MARKET EXPECTS BREATHING SPACE|After an onslaught of new paper, fewer mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said. Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today. "We want to have a week's pause," one manager said. Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks, including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank. Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks, from 3.6 billion in January. The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons. "I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you can give a good coupon," another manager said. But even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions. Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone, bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows. Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price. A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price. Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the 10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said. The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which they say is too inflexible. Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again. Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system. The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be completely abolished. "I don't think the Bundesbank would give that up," one banking analyst said. "I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system," the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves. The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket, he said. For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system. Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to the carnival holiday. Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday. In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon. REUTER

UAL <UAL> UNIT ATTACKED ON MINORITY HIRING|UAL Inc's United Airlines was accused in a congressional hearing today of locking blacks out of key jobs, but the company said it had made tremendous progress in minority hiring. The issue was aired during a hearing of a House Government Operations subcommittee whose chairman, Rep. Cardiss Collins, called the treatment of minorities by the country's largest airline "pathetic." "It strikes me odd," said the Illinois Democrat, "that the number of white women pilots is more than double that of black pilots, and that white women are more fairly represented in upper management." United has been under a court order since 1976 to increase its minority employment. David Pringle, United's senior vice president for human resources, said "We take a very aggressive approach to minority hiring and have made tremendous progress ... we will continue to pursue even wider goals."

FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS|French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was "increasingly ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets." "France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months," it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries." This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly," it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs. "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost," one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said. On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits. "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue," it said. REUTER

SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD|Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc <TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.

TAIWAN TO SEEK HIGHER TEXTILE EXPORTS TO U.S.|A Taiwan mission will leave next week for Washington to renegotiate an agreement severely limiting the growth of the island's textile exports, a Board of Foreign Trade official said. Under the agreement signed last July, Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988, based on the value of 1985 exports. The official said the pact was unfair because the United States had signed more favourable agreements with Hong Kong and South Korea. They were each given about one pct growth until 1991. He said Taiwan now found it difficult to compete with its two main rivals and the problem had been made worse because of the surging value of the Taiwan dollar. Reuter

DOT REJECTS SMOKING BAN ON DOMESTIC FLIGHTS|The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has concluded that a ban on smoking on all domestic airline flights is not justified at this time. The department made known its conclusions in a report to Congress, made public today, on a recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences that such a ban be adopted. "We agree that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could be viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers. However, we believe that further study is needed before the department can propose a definitive response to this recommendation," the DOT report said. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) had studied the issue of smoking on airlines under a DOT grant. It recommended a ban in August after concluding that tobacco smoke, when confined to an airliner's cabin, posed potential health hazards to cabin crew members, irritated passengers and crew, and created a risk of fires. The DOT said more study was needed of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke and of the concentration and distribution of pollutants on various aircraft types. It also called for more study of possible changes in aircraft ventilation systems and said it wanted to spend more time considering whether a ban should be extended to international as well as domestic flights.

JAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING|Japanese investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said. Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand, major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year, traders said. These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said. "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds, suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki. She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London. REUTER

SOUTH KOREA TO HOLD CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS DOWN|South Korea plans to take steps to keep its 1987 current account surplus below five billion dlrs, Economic Planning Board Minister Kim Mahn-je said. Kim told reporters the government would repay loans ahead of schedule and encourage firms to increase imports and investment abroad to prevent the current account surplus from rising too quickly.

INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE|Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports," the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves." "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy," the report says. Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s," the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry." "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture," the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. REUTER
