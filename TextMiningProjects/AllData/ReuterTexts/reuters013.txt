SILVER OPENS HIGHER IN ZURICH, GOLD UNCHANGED|Silver, trading at around two year highs, began sharply higher in relatively active trading, pulling platinum up a little in its wake, dealers said. However, gold began little changed. Silver began here at 6.74/79 dlrs an ounce, up 22 cents from the previous close here. It had briefly touched the 6.80 dlr level at the end of Far Eastern trading.

DOLLAR OPENS LOWER IN NEW YORK|The dollar opened lower following the trend set earlier in the Far East and Europe, dealers said. Still, the U.S. currency remained well within recent trading ranges because few operators are prepared to go out on a limb ahead of today's meeting of Group of Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washington. The overnight sell-off was partly due to skepticism that this week's monetary talks will yield new or lasting measures to stabilise currencies. But whatever their opinions, U.S. dealers remained cautious of selling the dollar aggressively. The dollar opened at 145.10/20 yen, down from 145.85/90. The dollar's decline occurred despite renewed Bank of Japan intervention on its behalf in Tokyo, dealers noted. Dealers in Japan said the central bank bought dollars steadily for yen during Tokyo hours. "There were some large sell-orders in Tokyo, but apparently it wasn't too hectic," said a dealer at one major U.S. bank. "The tone still is very cautious ahead of the Washington meetings." The dollar also opened at 1.8220/30 marks, down from 1.8260/70 at last night's close, and at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs, down from 1.5180/90. Meanwhile, sterling prolonged its advance with the aid of more public opinion polls indicating the ruling Conservative party would retain power with a large majority in any general election. Sterling rose to 1.6186/91 dlrs, from 1.6175/85 on Monday, but eased slightly to about 2.953 marks from 2.955. Dealers did not detect any U.K. intervention to subdue the pound today. Some said the U.K. central bank may have bought dollars for yen in Europe, but this could not be confirmed. The dollar eased to 1.3071/76 Canadian dollars from 1.3080/85 yesterday, showing limited response to president Reagan's endorsement of efforts for U.S./Canada free trade. Reuter

SUBROTO SAYS EXTENSION OF TIN PACT IS UNREALISTIC|An extension of the International Tin Agreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed to lapse, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told reporters. Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session of the International Tin Council on April 8-9, Subroto said Indonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look into how to replace the pact. But he said that given the present disagreement between producers and consumers, there is unlikely to be any follow-up to the ITA. Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension of the ITA, he said, "No one will propose that. It's also unrealistic to do so." Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the seven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to introduce a quota system which limited their exports and consumption to 96,000 tonnes in the year starting March 1. Indonesia's quota was set at 24,516 tonnes. REUTER

HUTTON <EFH> ENDS PUROLATOR <PCC> BID|Emery Air Freight Corp said it has entered into an agreement with E.F. Hutton Group Inc EFH under which Hutton will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer, effective April 13. Under its merger agreement, Hutton has the right to unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender offer, such as Emery's competing 40 dlr per share offer for Purolator stock. Yesterday, Hutton's PC Acquisition Corp subsidiary extended its tender offer, which was to have expired at midnight, for two more days. It said it only about 450,000 shares, or 6.5 pct, of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn, down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier. Emery's bid expires April 28. Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's merger agreement, PC has released Purolator from an agreement not to discuss Emery's acquisition proposal with Emery. Emery said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter into merger negotiations with it. Emery said if it were to acquire 51 pct of Purolator shares or control of the Purolator board, it has agreed not to dispute PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator due to the acquisition of control by another party. The company said it has also agreed to let Purolator pay all of PC Acquisition's documented expenses in connection with the merger agreement up to three mln dlrs and Emery has agreed to pay the amounts itself should Purolator fail to do so.

LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA|Rising demand for U.S. rice may gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the 1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on July 31. Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year, the report said. USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off. With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate, USDA said. "Development of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers," USDA said. USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U.S. "The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa," the report said. World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes, increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains. China, India and South Korea have increased output, while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid-1970s, the report said. Reuter
LUMBER FUTURES TUMBLE SHARPLY EARLY|Lumber futures fell for losses of as much as 3.50 dlrs per tbf, basis May, after starting 0.80 lower to 0.10 higher. Lack of carryover demand and pressure associated with the lower trend to financial futures early touched off some stop loss orders. Futures fell to near technical support before recovering slightly, traders said. Some pressure also stemmed from a quiet cash market and erroding cash prices, they said. Commission houses and locals sold on the break and offset scale-down buying by GNP, they added. Reuter
SWISS CONSUMER PRICES RISE ONE PCT IN MARCH|Swiss consumer prices rose one pct in the year to March, the same rise as in the year to February, and against 0.9 pct in the year to March 1986, the Federal Statistics Office said. In March alone, prices rose 0.1 pct after a 0.3 pct rise in February. The March index, base 1982, was 109.7 against 109.5 in February. The Statistics Office said the March increase reflected rises in certain sectors such as food, clothing and household goods and falls in transport, heating and lighting. Both home produced and imported goods rose by 0.1 pct during the month. But over the year as a whole, domestically generated inflation reached 2.5 pct, offset by a 2.8 pct drop in imports. REUTER

SHARE PRICES NEAR DAY'S LOWS AT LONDON MIDSESSION|Equities steadied near the day's lows at midsession after a hesistant start mainly due to lack of interest in quiet trading conditions. Dealers said most of the trading appeared to be inter-professional, highlighting the market's cautious approach in the wake of yesterday's strong performance. The latest opinion polls strengthened the market's conviction that the Conservatives will win the next general election, but the uncertainty over the date continues to provide an unsettling factor. At 1141 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 10.6 down at 1.979.0. In a poll conducted for television programme TV-AM showed the Conservative Party 13 points ahead of the Oppsition Labour Party. An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today, which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats, gave the Conservative party a lead of six points over Labour. Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan, although less pronounced, provides a further note of caution, dealers said. Yesterday the Japanese finance ministry said it will help expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitate foreign membership. The lack of enthusiasm for shares this morning despite gains to record territory on both the New York and Tokyo stock exchanges further underlined market nervousness. ICI fell a penny at 1,334, Glaxo 8p at 1,480, Beecham 12p at 521, BPB 10p to 660 and P and O 3p to 617.

Shell lost 10p at 1,223. Banks mostly showed modest declines. Barclays eased a penny to 503 as did Natwest at 588. Standard Chartered lost 4p to 821 after recent gains on bid speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday. Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds was one penny higher at 488. Extel further declined today, losing 28p to 462 in the wake of news yesterday British Printing and Communications Corp and its associates said they would not be making a bid for the company. In mixed insurances Sun Life gained 7p at 1,085, Prudential Corp rose a penny at 833 while Royal declined 4p to 945 as did Sun Alliance at 828.

BOUYGUES <BOUY.PA> TV AWARD SEEN BOOSTING GROUP|A consortium headed by the construction group Bouygues SA has been awarded a 50-pct controlling stake in French state television network TF1, which stock market analysts said represented a major boost for Bouygues. The Bouygues-led consortium was widely regarded as the less likely of the two candidates in contention to be awarded the three billion franc stake by the National Commission for Communications and Liberties (NCCL), the French television watchdog authority. The losing candidate was a consortium headed by publishing group Hachette SA <HACP.PA>. The NCCL decision awarded the Bouygues consortium a 50-pct controlling stake in a company which will have a 10-year operating concession for TF1, France's oldest and most widely watched television network. Independent market analysis group C.O.P.S. In a note on Bouygues said the award would represent a major diversification for the group out of the highly cyclical construction industry into the rapidly expanding media business. Bouygues in February said it estimated 1986 group net attributable profit at 480 mln francs, up from 443 mln for 1985, on consolidated turnover of 45.8 billion francs, up from 26.3 billion. The sharp rise in turnover reflected the groups acquisition of the loss-making SCREG construction group last year. Bouygues closed on the Paris stock market at 1,451 francs on Friday, up from 1,405 the previous day, but well below its year's high of 1,475. Hachette closed at 3,280, up from a previous 3,250. Bouygues holds a 50-pct stake in the winning consortium, giving it a 25-pct stake in TF1. The U.K.-based <Pergamon Media Trust> of Robert Maxwell has a 20-pct stake in the consortium, representing a 10 pct stake in TF1, while <Maxwell Media France> has a six pct stake, or three pct of the television network. Minority shareholders in the consortium include the <GMF/FNAC> group, Societe Generale <SGEN.PA>, <Editions Mondiale>, the <Groupe Bernard Tapie>, <Financiere Faltas>, <Banque Indosuez> and Credit Lyonnais <CRLP.PA>.

SUMITA SEES REAGAN BONDS FEASIBLE, SAYS NEWSPAPER|Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said he would support the issuance of Reagan bonds, yen-denominated U.S. Government securities, if it was considered appropriate, a Japanese daily paper reported. The Sankei Shimbun quoted Sumita as saying in an interview "It (Reagan bond) is a very feasible idea," speaking in the context of the effectiveness of such bonds in halting the dollar's decline. Asked how he would respond to the idea if it were brought up at any Group of Five meeting in Washington later this week, the paper quoted him as saying "I will back it up." But Sumita said the market still has confidence in the dollar, and one must be careful in associating the current dollar decline with anything like a free fall, the paper said.

DOE ISSUES OFFER TO BUY ALASKA POWER UNIT|The U.S. Energy Department issued a request for proposals to buy the Snettisham Hydroelectric project, a major part of the Alaska Power Administration. It said invitations were sent to two Alaskan electric utilities, the city and borough of Anchorage and the state of Alaska. It did not cite a possible purchase prices. The requests were limited to Alaskan entities because the purpose of privatization of the administration was to put the local utility into the hands of a local body, the DOE said. It added that proposals are due back by August three. The DOE said it then had 120 days to select a proposal that it would recommend to Congress, which then would vote the recommendation up or down. Proposals to buy the other major part of the Alaska Power Administration, the Eklutna project, was expected to be issued in early June, it said. reuter
JAPAN CONSIDERING BUYING U.S. SUPERCOMPUTER|Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is considering buying a U.S.-built supercomputer worth three to four billion yen, but a final decision and funding have yet to be determined, MITI said. The Cray II computer, made by Cray Research Inc <CYR>, would be used jointly by nine MITI research institutes in Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo, a MITI official told Reuters. Its purchase would be in line with MITI's goal of boosting imports, he said. Funds for the supercomputer are not included in the fiscal 1987 budget currently stalled in parliament. Funds could be provided in a supplementary budget likely to be introduced this autumn, the official said. The U.S. Has strongly urged Japan to open its public sector to sales of U.S. Supercomputers, and the complaint is a key issue in current U.S.-Japan trade friction. One year before it was privatised in April 1985, <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) bought a Cray supercomputer, an NTT official said, the only public sector purchase of a U.S. Supercomputer to date.

GERMAN BANK SUPERVISOR CALLS FOR WIDER REGULATION|West German banking regulations must be expanded to cover off-balance sheet risks arising from new financing forms, Federal Banking Supervisory Office President Wolfgang Kuntze said. Kuntze told bankers at a reception that deals for hedging price risks are not covered by current supervisory rules. Such deals could be used for speculation and do not have to be disclosed. Kuntze also said it must be considered whether banks can continue not to set shareholders' equity and reserves against their own holdings of securities. Since early 1984, banks have been limited to lending 18 times shareholders' equity and reserves on a consolidated basis and Bundesbank officials have said that interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under scrutiny. Authorities favour reinterpreting the banking law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said. Kuntze said solutions to the problem of banking supervision can be found without having to change the law again. The risk structure in banking is moving away from the model on which banking supervisory rules are based, Kuntze said. Banking supervisors are still firemen with a safety net but the safety net has become a little too small, he said. Kuntze declined to detail possible changes to banking regulations, as these are still the subject of discussions between the Supervisory Office and the Bundesbank. He said he sees no chance in the foreseeable future for an international harmonisation of supervisory law and the German supervisory office would not wait for such harmonisation. Nor would it get involved in international competition on minimal regulatory standards in order to shield banks from competitive disadvantages, he said. REUTER
CHRYSLER CANADA IMPORTS THAI-MADE MITSUBISHI CARS|<Chrysler Canada Ltd> said it signed an agreement to import 100,000 Mitsubishi small cars from <MMC Sittipol Co Ltd> of Thailand between 1988 and 1993. Chrysler Canada, a subsidiary of Chrysler Motors Corp <C> of the U.S., Will market the two and four-door cars in Canada under the Dodge-Colt brand. The cars will be Thailand's first car exports. MMC Sittipol is a Thai-Japanese joint venture in which Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> of Japan holds an estimated 47 pct stake. Its Thai partners are <Sittipol Motor Co> and <United Development Motor Industries Co Ltd>. Officials of MMC Sittipol said Chrysler Canada currently buys the same Dodge-Colt models from Japan where the strong yen has sharply increased their production costs. They said Chrysler will from next year import the same cars from Japan and Thailand which has a lower labour cost advantage. The officials said Mitsubishi's decision to move its production to Thailand also stemmed from the fact that Japan is facing auto export quota restrictions to the Canadian market. REUTER

EUROBOND MARKET GENERALLY FIRMER WHERE CHANGED|Secondary sectors of the eurobond market, where changed, were generally firmer in quiet morning trading with attention again tending to focus on currencies other than the dollar, dealers said. The sterling straight market opened with further gains of 1/8 or 1/4 point with sentiment boosted by the publication of two more opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party with a substantial lead over opposition parties. Dealers said operators seem a little more cautious this morning since profit-taking is expected to emerge soon after recent substantial gains. The dollar straight sector was little changed with yesterday's gains on the U.S. Bond market being balanced out by a slightly easier dollar. The market is now awaiting news which may emerge from tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting in Washington. "It's not often you can call the dollar straight sector a backwater in the market but that's what it is at the moment," a head trader at a U.S. Firm said. U.S. Treasury security trading was also quiet with retail participation limited to enquiry, dealers said. The 30-year long bond was quoted at 95-30/32 pct at 0845 GMT. The yen and Australian dollar sectors remained buoyant although volume was lower than yesterday morning, dealers said. Yen bonds were 1/4 to 3/8 point firmer with initial buying coming from the Far East, dealers said. The market was boosted by a very firm Japanese bond market in which the yield on the key 5.1 pct bond due 1996 dropped to close at 3.905 pct compared with yesterday's close of 3.955 pct. In the Australian dollar market there was some retail demand for zero coupon bonds, dealers said. REUTER
GERMAN BONDS END QUIET BOURSE LOWER|Prices of public authority bonds ended a quiet bourse session lower, with domestic investors taking profits in a technical reaction to recent strong gains. Dealers said long maturities dropped as much as 50 pfennigs but most paper lost around 20 pfennigs. Foreigners, which had been buying and selling West German public authority bonds in pre-bourse business, remained sidelined during bourse trading. Today's slight dollar drop and yesterday's modest gains on U.S. Credit markets had little impact. Dealers said this week's G-7 meeting in Washington made investors wary and led to the squaring of some positions. Most dealers said underlying sentiment for bonds remained favourable and there were some speculations global interest rates could fall further in the not too distant future. The Bundesbank bought 109.9 mln marks worth of public authority paper here after selling 80.7 mln yesterday. The six pct 1997 federal government loan stock fell 40 pfennigs to 102.90, 103.15. The 5-3/4 pct 1997 bond for the same address also shed 40 pfennigs to 100.90, 101.15. In contrast to the public authority bond sector, prices of mortgage and municipal paper firmed in active business, dealers said. 10-year yields fell two basis points to 6.26 pct.

KUWAIT MAY RE-REGISTER GULF TANKERS - NEWSPAPER|Kuwait may re-register part of its tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were quoted by the New York Times as saying. The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an admission of its need for protection, they said. Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European registries, the officials said. Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said. Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as saying. Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian attacks.

NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS|The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday, dealers said. Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning, with operators made wary by today's meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington. It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar. Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on February 22, a "vague statement," casting doubt on operators' assumptions that a secret target level had been set. Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged, "there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar." One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks. "They were obviously regarded as being negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative," he said. Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's undertone. Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said. After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31, interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said. "We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencies," the U.S. Bank dealer said. Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later. The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender, signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy. Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment. Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention, brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480. The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100. REUTER

Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric tons annual finished capacity.

KUWAIT SAID SEEKING FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR OIL|Kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf, Reagan Administration officials said. The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new "Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags. The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf. "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said. U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

U.S. DOLLAR CLOSES LOWER IN THIN HONG KONG TRADING|The U.S. Dollar closed lower after a day of thin trading as most operators were sidelined ahead of the International Monetary Funds meeting in Washington this week, dealers said. They noted the Group of Seven industrialised nations is expected to meet and discuss currency movements during the course of the IMF gathering. But some speculative selling of the dollar was noted on conviction that the Bank of Japan will intervene less during of the meetings. The dollar ended at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90. Dealers said, however, the Japanese central bank bought dollar persistently throughout today and limited the dollar's falls. The U.S. Unit eased to 1.8205/15 marks from an early 1.8230/40 and New York's 1.8260/70 close. It was under pressure also because most traders anticipated the currency meeting to bring little surprise, dealers said. Sterling advanced to 1.6200/10 dlrs from an early 1.6185/95 and New York's final 1.6175/85 on rising support to the ruling Conservative Party of Britain, dealers said. They said the pound gained ground on belief that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will call an early general election in June. But chartists said they expect strong resistance around 1.62 dlrs. Elsewhere the dollar fell to 1.5137/47 Swiss francs from New York's final 1.5180/90 and was lower at 6.0600/20 French francs against 6.0745/75. Asian dollar deposits were lower with the three months settling at 6-1/2 3/8 pct against Friday's close of 6-11/16 9/16 and the six months eased to 6-5/8 1/2 pct from 6-3/4 5/8. The Hong Kong dollar stayed on the weak side of its 7.80 peg with the U.S. Unit, finishing at 7.8015/35 against Friday's close here of 7.8005/25. Interbank rates were firmer following the local banks' move to raise prime rates by half-point to 6-1/2 pct, effective today, dealers said. The overnight rose to 4-1/2 1/4 pct from Friday's close of four 3-1/2, while the three months was unchanged at 5-1/4 1/16 pct. REUTER

GULF STATES (GSU) SEES END TO CASH BY MAY|Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana. In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs. "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code," Gulf States said. The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana. "If the regulatory commissions approve the company's proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability," Gulf States said. In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas. Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief. In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year. Reuter

U.S. DEFENDS STOCKPILED TIN SALES IN 1986|The United States defended its sales of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from Malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with southeast Asian producers. "The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the ASEAN states on GSA tin disposals," a State Department spokesman said in a statement. "The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into account in determining disposal levels," the statement said. The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983. In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. "The United States appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum of Understanding," it said. The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market conditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987, they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986. The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the GSA sold last year, however. Reuter

ITALY SAYS G-7 GIVES CHANCE TO VERIFY TOKYO ACCORD|This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said. It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year. On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its G-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier session of talks involving G-5 members. Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said- "Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever "the management or the improvement of the international monetary economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'" Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the grounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubber stamping agreements already taken. The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was "certain that this time incidents would not occur." But it said it would be opportune to look in depth at the role and the procedures of G-7 in relation to those of G-5. REUTER

CHINA REGION SUGAR OUTPUT RISES|The southwest Chinese region of Guangxi increased its production of sugarcane by 26.8 pct to 9.4 mln tonnes in the 1986-87 crushing season (November to March) from the previous year, the New China News Agency said. The cane, grown on 206,000 hectares, yielded 1.04 mln tonnes of refined sugar, it said without giving comparative figures.

IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND|Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said. Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the IEA said in its latest monthly report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct. The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said. IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said. Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March. And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter

LONG DEBT FUTURES TURN EASIER IN LIFFE MORNING|Long debt futures turned easier in late morning on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) as the dollar and sterling softened, dealers said. Long gilt futures had a good start with an opening range of 124-10/32 to 124-14/32 from 124-7/32 overnight as sentiment was boosted by two opinion polls showing a comfortable lead for the ruling Conservatives. They made a high of 124-19/32 but met chart resistance. A wave of professional sales hit the market at 1000 GMT, driving the price to a low of 124 after minor support at 124-6/32 was breached. This coincided with a dip in sterling to 72.2 on its trade- weighted index against 72.3 at the start and 72.4 last night. At the same time, the dollar was dipping below 145 yen after a night of pressure in the Far East. June T-bond futures made lows of 97-18/32 and settled around 97-21/32 at 1015 GMT after opening 8/32 easier at 97-26/32. Analysts said the markets remained cautious because of a series of talks in Washington this week between finance ministers of industrial countries. June Eurodollars started at 93.33, a technical support point, and eased to 93.30 or 0.06 below last night. Analysts said sterling contracts would have difficulty advancing beyond current levels if the market discounts the Conservative victory predicted by the opinion polls. Other difficulties were sterling's inability to breach the 2.96 mark ceiling, which could indicate the Bank of England is trying hard to keep a lid on the U.K. Currency. Also, market talk of a further base rate cut has died down, although another cut was virtually discounted by mid-March. June short sterling futures were little changed in early trading from last night's 90.78 but slipped to a low of 90.73 by late morning. Interbank interest rates were unchanged. June FT-SE 100 futures saw an opening range of 204 to 203.70 in line with last night's 203.80 but made a low of 202.20 late morning.

PARIS CLUB AGREES NEW AFRICAN DEBT INITIATIVE|Western creditor governments have reached agreement in principle on new proposals for easing the debt burden of sub-Saharan African countries, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He told journalists the accord, reached in the so-called Paris Club of western governments, calls for rescheduling the debts of sub-Saharan African countries over very long periods and on very favourable terms. The proposals will be put forward for discussion at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank Development Committee in Washington next week, he said. Lawson said that under the proposals countries could have 15 or 20 years to repay their debts along with have a grace period. But he added the favourable terms would not be offered indiscriminately to all nations in the region but granted on a case-by-case basis. The Paris Club groups Western governments -- as opposed to commercial banks -- which are owed money by poorer nations. Lawson was speaking after an informal gathering of European Community finance ministers and central bankers held to prepare for discussions on international monetary issues and Third World debt at next week's spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank. French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he had insisted at the gathering that developed countries take adequate account of the problems facing poorer nations that were trying to put their ailing economies in order. He told journalists he would be unveiling new proposals for dealing with the Third World debt problem in Washington. He declined to give details but Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who hosted the talks, indicated that Balladur's proposals involved giving a greater role to a World Bank fund used to compensate developing countries for falls in the prices of their main commodities. "The French ideas got a very sympathetic welcome," Eyskens told a news conference. He said the European Community felt a new IMF (International Monetary Fund) report which forecasts inflation-adjusted economic growth of just 2.5 pct in the industrialised world this year, compared with 3.1 pct expected last autumn, was slightly too pessimistic. Many economists believe industrialised countries need to grow by at least three pct a year if the world debt is to be brought under control. Eyskens added the Community wanted to give "certain nuances" to the IMF report that would be constructive for dealing with the Third World debt problem. However, Italian sources quoted Italian Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria as calling it scandalous that the meeting here did not include a discussion of what he called the problem of falling world demand. He complained that West Germany was refusing to do enough to boost demand while the United States, suffering from a massive trade deficit, was unable to do anything in this direction. REUTER

U.S. CABLE TV CREDIT UNLIKELY TO IMPROVE, SAYS S/P|Standard and Poor's Corp said that the credit quality of most U.S. cable television companies is unlikely to improve in the near term. S and P said that after two years and many delays and disappointments, the cable television industry has firmly established a net cash generating position. However, rather than using their improved position to decrease the leverage of current capital structures, the companies' cash flows are being fully leveraged to finance a wave of consolidations, S and P said. Many cable television companies exhibit greater financial risk because of their asset growth aspirations and debt-financed consolidation. That delays a lower risk profile for many of them, Standard and Poor's said. The acquisition and financial growth policies of many company executives heavily influenced the ratings outlook. Citing aggressive capital structures, acquisitions and cash flow coverages of interest expense of between 1.0 and 1.5 times, S and P noted that the companies are more debt intensive now than in their building phase. These factors keep their ratings at speculative grades, the agency concluded. Reuter

SINGAPORE STOCKS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE STRONG TREND|The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) will likely be used to raise more than 1.5 billion dlrs in 1987, continuing a long-term bullish trend that began last year when about the same amount was tapped. Stock analysts and economists said the trend will be helped by low interest rates and the government's plan to sell 380 mln dlrs worth of shares in state enterprises each year for the next 10 years, which should attract foreign interest. One foreign analyst said international fund managers are increasingly attracted to Asian markets like Singapore. He said uncertainty over Hong Kong's future had helped the flow of funds to Singapore over the last eight to nine months. Trade friction between Washington and Tokyo and the high value of the yen had also diverted a trickle of funds from Japan. But he added, "A slight trickle will have a large impact on the local exchange." Economists said the inflow from foreign institutions is difficult to estimate but it is increasing as the local recession bottoms out with the help of reduced corporate taxes cuts and of lower wage costs. Tan Soo Nan, director of the Development Bank of Singapore Securities Ltd and a member of the exchange, said he expects Singapore companies alone to tap around one billion dlrs this year, but he warned there were some short-term risks. Corporate earnings in fiscal 1987 ending March fell short of an expected 20 pct increase over 1986 and a major failure would dampen sentiment, he said. He added the SES should admit only companies able to sustain their earnings levels. But one foreign analyst said any slowing of activity would be temporary and many investors are waiting for the results of elections in Malaysia later this month. On the whole, Tan said, the long-term trend remains bullish because of the economic recovery, the high growth potential for the Asian Pacific region and the liberalisation of the Toyko financial market. Tan said the introduction of the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System in January and the new government securities market was in keeping with the global trend towards debt securitisation and financial deregulation. Singapore's economic recovery will be more broad-based in 1987 and the exchange's strategy should be to build up expertise in risk and fund management, he said. REUTER

GERMAN BONDS BARELY CHANGED IN QUIET PRE-BOURSE|Prices of public authority bonds were barely changed in quiet pre-bourse trading, with some foreign investors taking profits but others opening fresh positions. Dealers said long maturities fluctuated between gains and losses of around 10 pfennigs. Today's slight drop in the value of the dollar and yesterday's modest gains on U.S. Credit markets had little impact on business here. Domestic investors remained sidelined ahead of the G-7 meeting this week. Dealers said today's quietness was also a technical reaction to recent sharp gains. Mark eurobonds were little changed in thin trading. The six pct 1997 federal government loan stock fell 10 pfennigs to 103.20, 103.45. The 5-3/4 pct 1997 bond for the same address eased five pfennigs to 101.25, 101.50. Yields of mortgage and municipal paper eased one to two basis points in thin trading. 10-year yields fell to 6.26 pct from 6.28 and five-year yields declined to 5.13 pct from 5.15.

DOLLAR CLOSES LOWER IN TOKYO|The dollar closed lower on selling by speculators and by institutional investors hedging currency risks, dealers said. But the dollar's downward potential was limited by persistent Bank of Japan intervention throughout the day. Some dealers started to sell dollars on speculation that the Group of Seven meeting expected tomorrow in Washington is unlikely to produce any significant new measures to stabilize currencies, some dealers said. The dollar closed at 145.25 yen against 145.85/90 in New York and 146.00 at the close here yesterday. The dollar ended at 1.8205/15 marks against 1.8260/70 in New York. "The market consensus is that the G-7 meeting is unlikely to change present underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar and is likely just to reaffirm the February 22 Paris accord on currency stability," a manager at a Japanese bank said. The dollar decline seem to come to a halt near 145.00 yen after the Tokyo closing on shortcovering as many operators seem unwilling to hold large positions ahead of the G-7 meeting, some dealers said. The dollar ended at 1.8205/15 marks against 1.8260/70 in New York. +The market consensus is that a G-7 meeting is unlikely to change the underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar and is likely just to reaffirm the February 22 Paris accord on currency stability,+ a manager at a Japanese bank said. The dollar decline seemed to halt near 145.00 yen after the Tokyo close on shortcovering, as many operators seem unwilling to hold large positions ahead of the expected G-7 meeting, some dealers said. The market is closely watching for a probable meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa later today ahead of the G-7 meeting, dealers said. Some dealers said mere reaffirmation of the Paris accord would fail to stop the dollar's decline against the yen unless the U.S. And Japan make progress in resolving trade and other economic friction. Japan is expected to explain to the U.S. The guidelines of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's economic package to stimulate domestic demand, a senior party official said. Operators generally see the dollar as still likely to head downwards, probably sliding as low as 140.00 yen, despite the G-7 meeting, dealers said. The dollar ended at 1.5130/35 Swiss francs against 1.5180/90 in New York and sterling finished at 1.6205/15 dlrs against 1.6175/85. The firm tone of the pound is expected to remain for the time being due to bullish sentiment, mainly on speculation the ruling Conservative Party would retain power in expected general elections, although the Bank of England may intervene in the market, some dealers said. The Bank of Japan stepped into the market soon after the opening and continued to intervene in the market to buy dollars on a small-lot basis all day, dealers said. The mark/yen cross rate fell to 79.76 yen from 80.08 at the close here yesterday. Spot dollar/yen volume through brokers was 6.56 billion dlrs with a most actively traded rate of 145.55 yen compared with 146.10 here yesterday. REUTER

PHILIPPINES APPROVES 80 MLN DLR DEBT CONVERSION|The Central Bank has approved the conversion of 80.7 mln dlrs worth of Philippine debt into equity in local projects under a debt-to-equity swap program started last August, Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said. He told reporters the amount represented 57 transactions involving diversified investments. He said 90 applications to convert 316.7 mln dlrs of debt have so far been received by the Central Bank. Ongpin also said the International Finance Corp (IFC), a World Bank affiliate, would invest up to 12.5 mln dlrs in the First Philippine Capital Fund. The fund, to be launched jointly by New York investment house Shearson Lehman Brothers and IFC, was proposed by Ongpin during a trip to the United States in September. There was still no word on when the fund, designed to encourage private sector investment in the Philippines, would be launched. A telex from IFC to Ongpin said the IFC investment will consist of exchanging up to 12.5 mln dlrs face value of Philippine debt it holds. The capital fund and the Central Bank's debt conversion plan are both aimed at reducing the country's debt burden by enabling interested investors to buy government notes at a discount, repatriate these and convert them at full value in pesos. The proceeds will then be used to investing in local projects. The country's foreign debt now stands at 27.8 billion dlrs. REUTER
MARCH U.S. PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX UP AT 53.9|The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said. The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct. An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly. New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984. Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc <PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement." Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter. Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct. The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant. The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies. Reuter

The February all-retailers sales index, base 1980, was put at a final 125.0 after 122.3 in January. In the three months from December 1986 to February 1987, the level of sales was unchanged from the previous three months but was up by almost 6.0 pct from the same 1985/86 period. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, retail sales in February were 9.0 pct higher than a year earlier, the Department said. REUTER

ITALIAN GOVERNMENT EXPECTED TO FALL TOMORROW|Italy's government is expected to fall tomorrow after the majority Christian Democrats decided to withdraw their 16 ministers unless Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi resigned, political sources said today. They said the decision brought the prospect of early general elections even closer. After a tense eight-hour meeting, the Christian Democrat leadership late last night said it registered "the dissolution of the present government," in which the party provides more than half the 30 ministers. Party leader Ciriaco De Mita told reporters that when Craxi went to parliament for a confidence debate. "There won't be a Craxi government any more ... I don't believe you can have a confidence vote for a government which does not exist." Craxi announced today after being told of the Christian Democrat decision that a cabinet meeting would be held tomorrow afternoon and he would then go to the Senate (upper house). The sources said that at the cabinet meeting the Christian Democrats, senior partners in a coalition including Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans as well as the Socialists, would tell Craxi he had to resign. If he refused to do so and insisted on a full debate they would withdraw their ministers, forcing the collapse of the government before a confidence vote, the sources said. Reuter

The Conservative British government decided on Thursday to bring forward legislation allowing the possible imposition of a ban against foreign countries failing to allow reciprocal market access. It is due to take effect in three weeks. Twenty-nine Japanese banks, nine insurance companies and 58 securities houses currently operate in London, while only five British banks and eight securities firms are licensed in Japan. "We are sure reasonable men will come to a reasonable solution," said a spokesman for <Nomura International>, the biggest of the Japanese securities firms in London which could be targetted. The government decided to rush provisions of the Financial Services Act into effect largely in response to the failure of Cable and Wireless <CAWL.L> to gain what it considers a satisfactory stake in one of two consortia seeking to compete in Japan's international telephone business. However, British economists say the use of financial services countermeasures in the trade dispute would hurt Britain more than Japan. The British press expressed concern that was Howard was travelling with counterproductive or irrelevant ammunition. The Daily Telegraph commented that an unfortunate minister was being "despatched to Tokyo armed with a pistol pointing at his own foot." The Financial Times urged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to avoid provoking a "nasty backlash" from Tokyo. Japan appeared to be making no concessions ahead of Howard's trip and Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon on Friday sought to dispel some of the growing concern over the dispute. "We don't want a trade war," he said. "We're not interested in trade wars." But Channon made plain the government was determined that British firms should have the same opportunites in Japan as Japanese firms have in Britain and wanted a timetable set for this purpose.

MELLON <MEC> SUED BY SHAREHOLDER|Mellon Bank Corp said a shareholder filed a class action suit in Philadelphia in light of the precipitous decline in Mellon's stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Mellon's stock fell 3-1/2 to 40-7/8 today after plunging 6-1/4 yesterday after the bank holding company reported its first loss in its 118 years, according to the shareholder, John Paul Decker. Yesterday, the company said it expected to report a first quarter loss of between 55 mln and 65 mln dlrs and its intention to reduce the quarterly dividend. The shareholder charges that Mellon and its senior officers failed to disclose the company's true financial condition during the class period, between February 1, 1985 and April 2, 1987 Mellon said it had no comment because it had not yet seen the suit.

COLOMBIA ARRANGING TWO CO-FINANCINGS FOR PROJECTS|Colombia is in the process of arranging two co-financings for projects in the electrical sector, director of public credit Mauricio Cabrera said. He told journalists he expects an 86.6 mln dlr loan to be co-financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to be completed by the middle of next month. He also said talks have just concluded with the World Bank on a 200 mln dlr co-financing and that discussions with the bankers will begin later this month. Cabrera was here for the signing yesterday of a 50 mln dlr floating rate note. The floating rate note was the first such issue for Colombia, which has had limited access to the international capital markets since the eruption of the international debt crisis in 1982, despite its ability to avoid a rescheduling. The IADB co-financing is for Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA), a public electricity utility. The loan is for 10 years, with four years grace. Interest will be at 1-1/8 pct during the grace period after which the margin will rise to 1-1/4 pct, Cabrera said. There is also a front end fee of one pct. The cost of the project totals 301.6 mln dlrs, of which ISA will contribute about 100 mln and the IADB 115 mln, he added. Fuji Bank Ltd and Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd are arranging the commercial bank portion of the financing. Cabrera noted that only about 20 pct of the loan will be drawn this year. He said the World Bank co-financing is likely to come to the market no earlier than June. It is part of an overall financing for various projects in the electrical sector that will take four years and cost about 300 mln dlrs a year. Of the total cost, he expects the World Bank and the IADB to contribute about 700 mln dlrs, with the Export-Import Bank of Japan lending between 200 and 300 mln. The balance will come from commercial banks. Cabrera said that Colombia also plans one other issue in the international capital markets this year. The country expected to launch up to 120 mln dlrs in floating rate notes, but the market has virtually disappeared in the past few months as supply outstripped demand and the number of market makers contracted sharply. Cabrera said he is now considering several options, including a fixed rate Eurobond and an issue in Japan. Last year Colombia arranged a private placement in Japan for the equivalent of about 40 mln dlrs. Although it prefers a public issue, Colombia would place any financing in Japan privately. Bankers noted that the floating rate note signed yesterday, which was for seven years with four years grace and paid 1-1/8 pct over Libor, was basically a "disguised loan." Cabrera said that as of December 31, 1986, Colombia had 11 billion dlrs of public sector foreign debt and 3.4 billion dlrs of private sector debt. Of its planned total borrowings this year of two billion dlrs, he said that about 1.4 billion had been arranged before the end of 1986 and that most of the borrowings in 1987 will be drawn in future years.

NEWS CORP'S <NWS> FOX DEBUTS U.S. NETWORK|Fox Broadcasting, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, is set to launch two prime time television shows this Sunday on what some have called the fourth television network. The company, built around Murdoch's two billion dlr acquisition of seven television stations last year, marks the first network startup since 1948, when ABC, now owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc <CCB>, hit the airwaves. "I think our goal, more than anything else, is to provide an alternative to the three networks," said Fox president Jamie Kellner. Fox's debut comes when earnings at two of the three networks are under pressure and network advertising dollars have been growing slowly. "The barriers to entry are exceptionally high," industry analyst Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence said. "Their (Fox) saving grace is that their parent has deep pockets." The question television industry, advertising and Wall Street executives are asking is whether this new entry can lure advertisers from the big three: CBS Inc <CBS>, ABC, and NBC, a unit of General Electric Co <GE>. Network advertising revenues rose to 8.6 billion dlrs in 1986 from 8.3 billion a year earlier, with NBC accounting for all of the gain. Revenues at CBS and ABC declined, analysts noted. "They (Fox) are competing for the same pool of funds as the traditional networks," said Jon Mandel, associate media director at Grey Advertising Inc. But James Mandelbaum, a Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney said, "If they have enough money, they have a good chance of making it work." Fox president Jamie Kellner said the company expects to lose 30 to 50 mln dlrs this year on revenues of about 150 mln dlrs. He said it will take three to five years to turn a profit. To succeed, the company must also win over the young viewership it has targeted with an offbeat set of shows, two of which debut this Sunday, and another, next weekend. The first Fox-produced program -- "The Late Show," featuring comedienne Joan Rivers -- was shown last fall on Fox's seven stations and close to 100 affiliates. Although the show has dropped recently in ratings, it still has a captive young audience in the late night time slot, analysts said. Sunday's prime-time shows include a situation comedy, "Married ... with Children," which Kellner describes as an alternative to the suger coated family shows on the networks. It is also airing "The Tracy Ullman Show," featuring the British comedienne, singer and actress. Fox has lined up 107 independent TV stations around the U.S. to run the shows. The networks have some 637 affiated stations. To make sure viewers get a chance to see the programs, the company is taking the unprecedented step of airing them three times in the course of the evening. "I believe if some of their shows were on the traditional networks, it would be extremely high-rated," Mandel said, who added that his firm has signed up several million dlrs in advertising for the shows. But some question whether Fox will really become a fourth network. Robert Adler, president of the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau, said many cable shows are geared to the audience Fox is attempting to win. "There are already many alternatives out there to the three networks," he said. And at least one network is not yet ready to consider Fox the competition. An ABC spokesman said, "the schedule we've put together for this Sunday night ... has not taken Fox's programming schedule into account." But analysts noted that the major networks are keeping a eye on the venture to see how it fares in the ratings and with its advertisers. Fox also appears willing to take a long-term view. Asked whether the company will be looking at ratings after Sunday's debut, Kellner said, "the last thing I want to do is worry about ratings because that was the last thing Murdoch told me to do."

U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE|Four U.S. meat processors have asked the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co, Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as the species from which it was derived. For example, "pork" would be listed on the ingredients statement instead of "mechanically separated pork." Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat and poultry portion of the product. Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said. Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient statement as "mechanically separated (species)," USDA said. USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid using mechanically separated meat in their products because the term carries an "unwarranted negative connotation" in the minds of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar regulation exists for poultry products. Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment. Reuter

FRANC ZONE MINISTERS CALL FOR MORE AID|Finance ministers from African countries in the French franc currency zone called for more aid from the international banking community at a meeting here last Friday, the French finance ministry said in a statement. The talks, held to prepare for this week's International Monetary Fund interim committee meeting in Washington, underlined that a considerable decline in bank aid to developing nations was a major source of worry. The ministers noted that this decline was contrary to expectations on debt strategy which emerged from the October 1985 IMF general assembly in Seoul. "Even if to a certain extent the efforts of banks can be helped out by those of private investors, the contribution of the international banking community remains indispensable," the statement said. They underlined the need, given present circumstances, for a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to relieve tensions on the exchange reserves of numerous developing countries, the statement added without elaborating.

AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR CLOSES ABOVE LOWER OPENING LEVEL|The Australian dollar staged a strong recovery on the local market after sharp overnight falls offshore, as a weak U.S. Dollar and capital inflow into local gold stocks and securities boosted demand, dealers said. The dollar closed at 0.7092/97 U.S. Dlrs, after opening easier at 0.7040/45 from U.S. Lows of 0.7030/40. But the dollar still had not recovered to yesterday's local closing levels of 0.7109/14. Traders are confident the local unit will return above 0.7100, and they regard today's fall as a correction in the currency's recent uptrend. Traders said the Australian dollar, after trading around 0.7040/50 for most of the day, surged to its day's high in late afternoon trading on Asian buying. They said offshore traders are still bullish towards the Australian dollar as yesterday's U.S. Selling occurred in thin volume. Nervousness over the short-term direction of the U.S. Dollar ahead of the International Monetary Fund meeting also provided support for the Australian dollar. In Asia, the U.S. Dollar ended lower at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90.

EQUITIES OPEN MIXED IN QUIET LONDON TRADING|Share prices opened mixed in relatively quiet trading after early indications suggested a positive move forward on the back of the latest opinion polls and record closing highs on the Tokyo and Wall Street stock exchanges. At 0815 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 4.7 off at 1984.5. Dealers said the effect of news today of two opinion polls, one of which, conducted for the television programme TV-AM, placing the Conservative party 13 points ahead of the Opposition Labour Party was offset by a belief that the market's gains yesterday may have been overdone and that a period of consolidation is due. An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today which measured party support in marginal seats gave the ruling Conservative Party a lead of six points over the Labour Party. Operators said although the market is generally convinced the Conservatives will win the next general election, uncertainty over the date is continuing to provide an unsettling influence. Among the leaders, ICI lost 2p at 1,333, Beecham 8p at 525 and Glaxo 4p at 1,484 but Wellcome lost 25p at 393 on profittaking, dealers said.

Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one-year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds rose one penny to 488.

UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION WITH JAPAN|The U.K. government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard, political sources said. Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit. Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources said. Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions. Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc, government officials said. But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger, they added. Reuter
U.S. CREDIT MARKETS OPEN LOWER|U.S. credit markets opened lower, undercut by a weaker dollar, dealers said. The impetus for the opening declines came from overseas trading, where a lack of retail buying led to profit-taking that erased yesterday's moderate gains, dealers said. Most investors have stepped to the sidelines to await the outcome of this week's monetary meetings in Washington and to see how it affects exchange rates, they added. The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond opened 17/32 lower at 95-22/32 to yield 7.88 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close. It fell to 95-26/32 in late Tokyo trade. "How the bond market trades seems to be a mirror image of how the dollar/yen trades," a dealer said. "As the dollar goes, so goes the market, but so far we're just bouncing around in thin trading." Skepticism that this week's monetary meetings of leading industrial nations in Washington will produce substantive agreements to ease trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan and take pressure off the dollar is weighing on bond prices. "I can't imagine that anything of much substance could comoe out of these meetings other than a reiteration of previous statements," a dealer said. Dealers said U.S. government securities prices will be vulnerable as long as further dollar declines are expected. The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/16 to 99-20/32 at the opening and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 11/32 to 97-25/32. Treasury bill rates rose in early trading, pulled higher in sympathy with the rise in coupon yields. Three-month bills were unchanged from yesterday's auction price at 5.53 pct bid, while six-month bills rose six basis points from their auction price to 5.69 pct bid. Year bills rose four basis points to 5.77 pct bid. The Federal funds rate opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained at this level in early trading. It averaged 6.20 pct yesterday. Economists said seasonal pressures on bank reserves point to a possible indirect injection of temporary reserves by the Federal Reserve this morning. Some look for the Fed to purchase coupon securities this afternoon. Dealers said the market may take its next cue from Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's Congressional testimony at 1000 EDT (1400 GMT) this morning. Reuter

BUNDESBANK RETAINS MONEY SUPPLY POLICY|Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates. Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy. The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy. Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria, noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting. "Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy," he explained. Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down. Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller said. The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path, he said. "Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months," he added. "All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite suppositions to the contrary," Mueller said. "Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks," Mueller said. Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy. Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate. In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S. Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said. But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank. Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other market conditions, Mueller said. A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator. This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said. The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports. "If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows," he said. Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high. In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter. The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said. But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities. "Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else," he said. REUTER

LONDON SUGAR FALLS TO SESSION LOWS BY MIDMORNING|Raw sugar futures fell to session lows by midmorning, suffering losses from last night of between 2.20 and 1.80 dlrs a tonne in a 341 lot volume, dealers said. Lack of follow-through, both here and in New York, featured the extended fall which triggered light liquidation and technical selling as prices eased, dealers said. There are no tenders expected today but tomorrow sees enquiries by India and Syria, to coincide with the weekly export tender by the European Commission, they said. Near Aug was trading at 154 dlrs after 70 minutes versus 155.80 bid last night and an early high of 155.80. London Daily Raws prices fell 3.50 dlrs on tone to 147 Fob and 171 (105.50 stg) Cif.

U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING|A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said. U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February. "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters." "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy," he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can't tighten." David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected. While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes." In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP." Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. "This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tighten to quickly either." The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined to ease," he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten, regardless of the dollar." Reuter
BRITISH OPINION POLLS CONFIRM THATCHER LEAD|Public opinion polls showing a surge in support for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following her trip to Moscow have raised the possibility she will call a spring election, political analysts said. A poll in today's Daily Express showed 39 pct support for the ruling Conservative party, 30 pct for the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats and 29 pct for the Labour party. Reproduced in a general election, the result would give Thatcher an overall parliamentary majority of 22. A poll in yesterday's Sunday Times gave the Conservatives 41 pct support, 12 percentage points ahead of both opposition groups -- their biggest lead in three-and-a-half years. Conservative sources have said Thatcher would prefer a series of polls giving her party over 40 pct of the vote, securing it a clear parliamentary majority, before announcing the date for the next election. Lord Whitelaw, Conservative leader in the House of Lords and one of Thatcher's closest advisors, yesterday ruled out a May general election, but left open the choices of June and early autumn. The Sunday Times poll, taken during Thatcher's visit to Moscow last week, was the first to show the party breaking through 40 pct. The Express poll was the first since Thatcher's trip to Moscow, hailed as a triumph by the British media. It confirmed a number of recent surveys suggesting that the Alliance had overtaken Labour. Thatcher, currently serving her second consecutive term of office, does not have to call elections until June 1988 but is widely expected to do so within the next six months. REUTER

VOLCKER WARNS AGAINST SIZEABLE DLR DECLINE|Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing. "In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive," he said. Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker said. On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade. "What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made," he said. "That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead," he said. Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow. Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would have to slow its spending growth. It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital. "The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts," he said. Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation, he said. Reuter

SPAIN'S SOCIALISTS HOLD OUT AGAINST STRIKERS|Widespread strikes have not seriously disrupted Spain's economy and wage restrictions are likely to continue as policy makers call for more austerity to help the country compete in the European Community (EC), foreign bankers and analysts said. "The strikes were unexpected and in some cases spectacular, but they have had little effect on basic economic life," a U.S. Banker told Reuters. "The socialists can apply restrictive measures as long as the unions remain relatively weak." The communist-led Workers' Commissions recently rejected a call by its leadership for a general strike while the ruling Socialist Party's trade union arm, the General Workers' Union, has refused to demonstrate with the communists on May 1. The government's chief concern is inflation, which stood at 8.3 pct last year. The high inflation rate is especially damaging in view of Spain's trade balance with Europe, which turned into a deficit last year after entry to the EC. Officials say the situation is rapidly deteriorating. The deficit of 450 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 was only slightly below the 515 mln dlr deficit for all of 1986. The government has tightened up money supply, called for maximum 5.0 pct wage increases -- the same as this year's inflation target -- and is pursuing a program of industrial restructuring despite an unemployment rate of 21.5 pct. Bankers say tight-money policies have attracted an avalanche of foreign capital that is cashing in on the strong peseta and high interest rates and those funds, converted into pesetas, are swelling money supply still further. Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said last week that money supply is expected to rise 14.3 pct in the first quarter compared with this year's eight pct target. Most analysts agree that the government will have to accept inflation closer to six pct this year but they say there is little cause for alarm. "The money supply should be back on track by the summer and we will begin to see lower interest rates," said Andres Trujillo, general manager of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp's Madrid branch. He told Reuters the labour protests, despite occasional outbursts of violence, are not having a serious impact on foreign investment. "Spain is a big and relatively underdeveloped market," he said. "It is still easier to compete from here than in other countries and this sporadic unrest is not likely to scare off investors." Juan Jose Macaya, general manager of Investban SA, a portfolio management company, said he expects monetary objectives to be under control in two or three months. "There has been some nervousness in the stock exchange but we see this as a short-term reaction," he said. REUTER
AIRBUS TO USE GE <GE> ENGINE ON A-340 AIRLINER|The European <Airbus Industrie> consortium is to change the lead engine on its A-340 aircraft because the high-technology superfan engine will not be ready by 1992, a company spokesman said. Airbus has chosen the Franco-U.S. CFM-56-S3 engines to replace the <International Aero Engine> (IAE) consortium's superfan. The spokesman added the new engine, to be produced by General Electric Co of the U.S. And SNECMA of France, can provide greater thrust than the IAE rival. The spokesman said the IAE consortium, which includes Pratt and Whitney of the U.S. And Britain's <Rolls Royce>, is unable to supply its superfan engines in time for mid-1992 when the A-340 is due to become operational. Airbus signed an agreement with IAE last December, replacing an earlier accord with GE and <SNECMA>, whose CFM-56 engine could then offer no more than a 28,600 lbs thrust, compared to the proposed superfan's 30,000 lbs. The latest version of the CFM-56, however, can provide a 30,600 lbs thrust. The Airbus spokesman said the consortium's decision did not exclude the IAE superfan, once ready, being offered as an alternative engine on the A-340 as the superfan was more fuel-efficient than the CFM engine. The spokesman said Airbus expected IAE to come back with some proposals on superfan's new production timetable within the next few weeks or months. Reuter

LAWSON SAYS U.K. ELECTION NOT ONLY EMS BAR|British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS). But he added that arguments against joining had weakened. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest. But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership. In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism, there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered, he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work." But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem. As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency, which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearly weakened," he said. Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review. REUTER

CAESARS WORLD BOARD APPROVES RECAPITALIZATION|Caesars World Inc <CAW> said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World. Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization. Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff. Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer. The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday. "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years," Gluck said. He said that after the recapitalization takes effect, proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs. Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding. Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization." He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization. Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June. The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities. As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a "fair price" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders. Caesars World said in a statement that "the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit. But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements.

OIL PRICES SEEN HOLDING STEADY IN SECOND QUARTER|Japanese oil traders generally expect oil prices to remain steady through June, when the next Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting is scheduled to take place. Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a month, despite coming under considerable pressure in February as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly resist paying official prices, trade sources said. Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily to stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said. Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month, mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its 15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members would submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said. However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and output targets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said. Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend to demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting from Japanese buyers. The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels to store its production rather than cut its prices, they said. Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below its ceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpd compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle East Economic Survey estimated. "Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to destroy the market," an oil trader in Tokyo said. Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades have not generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said. The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20 to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crude under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be weaker, traders said. Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, or raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE|The United States has appealed for stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to enforce world trade rules. The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade. Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate. Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round. "The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy," Smith said. "Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak, or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy." He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies. Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics. "We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings," he said. GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement. President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose tariffs against Japanese electronic goods. He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to U.S. Exports. REUTER

ENIM OIL SIGNS CONTRACT WITH INDONESIA'S PERTAMINA|<Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed a production sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra. It was the second production sharing contract signed by Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986. The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour. Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln dlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two years. The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment. A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now made seismic survey possible. The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February. Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's favour with operational costs deducted. Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds oil. Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for refining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a day. REUTER

JAPAN RULING PARTY SEEKS BIG SUPPLEMENT BUDGET|The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a senior party official said. The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's Chairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposed supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than August but before November. It also urges the government to concentrate in the first half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record proportion of the year's public works spending. The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. this week when Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the meetings with the IMF and G-7 ministers, Ito added. The LDP suggested the government review the ceiling on budgetary requests for investment in public works projects presented by individual ministries, Ito said. But the LDP official said the government should not abandon its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990. These measures should be treated as an emergency, partly because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external trade imbalance with the U.S., He said. The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29 for talks with President Reagan, Ito said. The full government-endorsed economic package is expected to be announced in late May. The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88 half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previous record for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87. Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks. An LDP statement said the government should use the additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise. Reuter
INDONESIA IMPORTS 12,000 TONNES CUBAN SUGAR|Indonesia has imported 12,000 tonnes of refined sugar from Cuba to meet consumer demand in the province of South Sulawesi, the head of the provincial food agency said. The imported sugar was needed because two of three sugar refineries in the province have been temporarily shut down. It arrived in the provincial capital of Ujungpandang today and will be distributed to markets in the province, the food agency official said. Indonesia used to be a sugar exporter but last year it imported 162,500 tonnes of sugar from Thailand, Angola and Brazil to bolster its depleted stocks. Indonesia's sugar cane production last year was expected to rise significantly but domestic sugar consumption has soared because of rising demand by the food processing industry, the head of the food logistics agency, Bustanil Arifin, has said. The government has forecast that sugar production in calendar 1987 would increase 30.2 pct to 2.59 mln tonnes from 1.99 mln in 1986 but industry sources doubt whether the target could be met due to persistent post-harvest handling and transport problems.

SOVIET GRAIN PRODUCTS MINISTRY CRITICISED|The Soviet Communist Party has criticised the country's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure proper grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and for unsatisfactory book keeping, Pravda said. The party daily said that losses in the industry owing to waste and theft amounted to 7.3 mln roubles over the last two and a half years. The situation was particularly bad in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, which has been severely criticised since the ousting of its veteran leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev last December. Its new leader, Gennady Kolbin, has said that at times the grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves. Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products Minister Grigory Zolotukhin, 75, was being retired and replaced by Alexander Budyka, a senior food industry official.

CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS|Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. "But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future," Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said. "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant," he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report. "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. "The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected," Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more," Maciej said.

CHINESE CROPS HIT BY FROST, SNOW AND RAIN IN MARCH|Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said. It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade below average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan, making early rice sowing difficult. Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and sowing, the paper said. The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal. Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood season, it said. It gave no further details. The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late February. It gave no 1986 figures for comparison. REUTER

U.S. TREASURY MARKET ENDS SHARPLY HIGHER|The U.S. Treasury market ended sharply higher, reassured by news that the Federal Open Market Committee voted in February to maintain the then-existing degree of restraint on bank reserves, dealers said. News of a weaker-than-expected March employment report and a minor bounce back in the dollar prompted short-covering that pushed coupon issues higher, while an easing in the Federal funds rate below six pct helped short-dated issues. The key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price finished 3/4 higher at 95-27/32, pushing the yield down to 7.86 pct from 7.93 pct yesterday. Danuta Zielonka of Wertheim Schroder Co Inc said that recent slowing in the growth of the monetary aggregates is a another factor arguing against firmer Fed policy. "Money growth has been slowing perceptibly in March which should give them more room to not tighten," she said. "Both M2 and M3 are will be at the low end of their target ranges in March." "The FOMC minutes are neutral for the bond market," Zielonka said. "Dollar considerations will prevent them from easing anytime soon, but they can't tighten with the economy weak and the banks having to deal with Brazil." Doubts on the economy's strength were underscored not only by a smaller-than-expected 164,000 gain in March non-farm payrolls, but also by a downward revision in February's gain to 236,000 from a previously reported 337,000. The market's initial reaction to the data was restrained by fears the employment news would undermine the dollar, but when the dollar maintained a firm tone, the bond market extended its gains. Profit-taking pulled bond prices down from the day's highs, but a record close in the U.S. stock market stimulated buying late in the day that offset this somewhat. Still, coupon issues were unable to recover completely from this week's steep losses as trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan pressured the dollar and discouraged Japanese investors from buying U.S. Treasury bonds. The current 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond traded down to 94-11/32 in Tokyo this week, pushing the yield to 7.98 pct. This capped the U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seen yesterday. Treasury bills advanced on the week. The six-month bills rose one basis point, but three-month bills fell 17 basis points and the year bill fell two basis points. Dealers said that the sharp drop in three-month bills resulted in part from recent outright bill purchases for a customer, believed to be related to heavy intervention by foreign central banks to support the dollar. A drop in the Fed funds rate to 5-15/16 today underpinned a decline in bill rates. It traded at this level throughout the session, down from yesterday's 6.14 pct average. Three-month bills closed two basis points lower at 5.48 pct bid. Six- and 12-month bills both dropped nine basis points to respective bids of 5.70 pct and 5.75 pct. Reuter

EQUITIES DRIFT LOWER ON EASIER WALL STREET OPENING|Equities drifted lower after the easier opening on Wall Street, but the London market was depressed from the outset on lack of interest and a feeling that yesterday's gains were overdone, dealers said. Much of today's business was inter-professional, but dealers noted that despite today's falls and low volume the market still had a firm, although cautious, undertone. At 1430 GMT the FTSE 100 index was down 8.1 points at 1,981.5 compared with an opening 1,987.4. Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan, although less pronounced, provided further caution. Yesterday, the Japanese finance ministry made moves to try and dispel fears of a trade war by saying it will help to expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitate foreign membership. However, British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard has told Japan to resolve the row over Cable and Wireless' shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations. Cable and Wireless, which has been at the centre of the trade row, was up 2p at 372. The latest media opinion polls helped to underpin prices as they strengthened the belief that the ruling Tory party will win the next U.K. General election. Although there is still uncertainty over the timing of the election, most dealers polled by Reuters this afternoon thought that June would be the most likely time. A poll conducted for the breakfast television programme TV-AM showed the Conservatives 13 points ahead of the Opposition Labour Party, while a poll in the Times newspaper, which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats, gave the Tories a lead of six points over the labour opposition. Market leader ICI stood unchanged at 1,335 but IC Gas slipped 14p to 752 on profit-taking after yesterday's stong gain while Jaguar rose 15p to 590 mainly on U.S demand ahead of a motor show in New York. Pharmaceuticals had Wellcome down 23p to 397 on further profit-taking in the wake of adverse press comment on the side effects of its "Retrovir" aids drug. London International Group gained 13p to 301 as operators switched out of Wellcome. Extel lost a net 26p to 464 in the wake of yesterday's news that Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp would not be making a bid for the company. In a generally easier oil sector, BP fell 18p to 912 after yesterday's statement by Standard Oil that it considered BP's 70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of the company it does not already own as "inadequate." In banks, Standard Chartered lost 4p to 820 after its recent gains on the back of bid rumours, but dealers noted press speculation that Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court had increased his stake in the company yesterday. Many operators expect Lloyds bank to renew its offer for Standard once its one year bid limit ends in July, although some dealers thought this unlikely. Lloyds gained 1p to 488. Elsewhere, industrial group Norcros gained 9p to 448 on speculation of a bid for the company, while food retailer Tesco added 2p to 475 after extending its 151 mln stg contested bid for Hillards Plc until May 1. Hillards was a penny up at 314. Government bonds stood generally lower in late trading with prices drifting down on a lack of interest. Gilts gained around 5/16 point at the outset on the back of the opinion polls. Equities tended to move up in later quiet trading as Wall Street rallied from its early lows. At 1556 GMT the FTSE 100 was down just 4.7 points at 1,984.9 after a low of 1,977.2 at 1354 GMT. Dealers said most in the market appear to expect share prices to move higher tomorrow, but volume will remain relatively light ahead of an announcement of the election date. They said given the thin trading conditions the market's movements will be volatile in the coming few sessions. REUTER
JAL PLANE CRASH THOUGHT DUE TO BOEING <BA.N> FAULT|A Japanese government investigation team believes that faulty repairs by Boeing Co caused the worst single plane crash in history, one of the team said. Boeing Co is the manufacturer of the Japan Air Lines 747 jumbo jet which crashed into a mountain in Japan on August 12, 1985, killing 520 people. There were only four survivors. A Boeing spokesman, contacted by telephone at the firm's headquarters in Seattle, Washington, told Reuters the firm would probably have no comment to make until the Japanese investigation team's report was officially released. The team investigator, a Japanese Transport Ministry official who declined to be identified, said a failure by Japanese aircraft inspectors to check the repair work done on the plane by a Boeing team had provoked an internal debate in the Ministry over inspection procedures. The Ministry official told Reuters that a report by his team, which has already been sent in draft form to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention, the draft must be submitted for final comments to the pertinent authorities. Asked on Thursday about Boeing's role in the crash, a Ministry spokesman declined comment. On September 6, 1985, Boeing issued an official statement saying that repairs it had undertaken on the doomed Japan Air Lines plane in 1978 were faulty. However, no official, direct connection was then made between the faulty repairs and the crash. The Japanese investigation team says in its draft report that it believes those faulty repairs were the cause of the 1985 accident, the investigator said. The Boeing statement after the crash said: "Examination of the wreckage, the flight data recorder readout, the cockpit voice recorder, and interviews with the surviving off-duty flight attendant indicate that decompression occurred in flight due to a rupture of the aft pressure bulkhead. "The Boeing examination of the bulkhead at the site of the crash has revealed that a relatively small section of the bulkhead splice, approximately 17 per cent, was not correctly assembled during repairs which Boeing made after a 1978 landing accident," the statement said. The repairs were required after a 1978 landing accident at Osaka airport, in western Japan, in which the plane's tail scraped the runway. The Japanese report also mentions the government inspectors who in 1978 signed a certificate of airworthiness approving the repairs, he said. Police had investigated four inspectors, including one man who two weeks ago killed himself by drinking insecticide after four days of police questioning. "None of the four had looked at Boeing's repair work," the investigator said. REUTER
CANADA BUDGET DEFICIT RISES IN JANUARY|The Canadian government's budget deficit rose to 1.78 billion dlrs in January from 1.67 billion dlrs in the same month last year, the finance department said. But the deficit in the first 10 months of the fiscal year which began on April 1, 1986, fell to 22.36 billion dlrs from 25.74 billion dlrs in the same period a year ago. January revenues rose to 7.96 billion dlrs from 7.56 billion dlrs while expenditures grew to 9.74 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs. Revenues in the first 10 months increased to 70.06 billion dlrs from 62.30 billion while expenditures grew to 92.42 billion dlrs from 88.05 billion. Reuter
U.S. TO PRESS FOR FASTER JAPANESE, GERMAN GROWTH|The U.S. Administration, under Congressional pressure to cut the trade deficit, will urge Tokyo and Bonn to meet commitments to speed economic growth to stabilise currencies at Wednesday's meetings of leading industrial nations in Washington, monetary sources said. The U.S. Will also try to develop proposals made at the 1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as the Paris Accord are more binding, they said. Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflect U.S. Frustration with the two countries for not moving fast enough to curb their huge trade surpluses, they added. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to bring the outline of an economic stimulus package to the meeting, which will be attended by West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada as well as the U.S. And Japan, the sources said. "The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention to announce a stimulative package,the better it is for Japan and for the exchange markets in general," one of the sources said. Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement, in which West Germany and Japan made their commitments, will be renewed by the industrial countries this week. Other U.S. Officials said a meeting of the Group of Seven will be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have made setting up stimulus measures. The U.S. Will tell its partners that it expects a further substantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed with Congress this year, the sources said. Washington would like its economic partners to establish specific economic policy goals. Sharp deviations from the set objectives would trigger consultations among the countries on appropriate corrective action, they added. The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan and West Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more imports and the U.S. Cutting its budget deficit, thereby depressing its demand for imports. But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may be far below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck, the sources said. Monetary sources also said the dollar's recent sharp fall against the yen reflected the U.S.-Japanese dispute over semi-conductor trade which resulted in U.S. Tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods. One of the sources said the dispute has to some extent soured the atmosphere ahead of the meetings. Congressional sentiment for protectionist measures, aimed particularly at Japan, has strengthened, the sources said. REUTER
SYNGOLD DEFINES RESERVES ON DEKA PROPERTY|<Syngold Exploration Inc> and <Corp Falconbridge Copper> said they defined undiluted reserves of 911,000 tons of ore with an average grade of 0.43 ounces of gold per ton in two separate deposits on the Deka property located at Noranda, Quebec. Assay results from 20 suface holes drilled on 250 foot centers indicate that the Donalda number one deposit contains possible reserves of 611,000 tons at an average grade of 0.48 ounces of gold per ton. The number one deposit's reserves are contained between a vertical depth of 750 and 1200 feet at a strike length of 900 feet. Reserves of the Donalda number-two deposit, located 1,000 feet below the number-one deposit, were recalculated at 300,000 tons with an average grade of 0.33 ounces of gold per ton. Syngold has earned a 20 pct interest in the Deka property from the operator, Corp Falconbridge Copper. Reuter
U.S. ENERGY FUTURES POST GAINS AFTER FIRM OPEN|Light mixed buying around the rings boosted U.S. energy futures to new daily highs after a slightly firmer open, traders said. May crude jumped 15 cts to 18.82 dlrs a barrel, nearing the top end of a 17.75-18.85 dlrs resistance range. Traders said firmness in the North Sea Brent cash crude market plus reports of escalation in the Iran/Iraq war lent support to crude futures. April 15-day forward Brent crude traded as high as 19.40 dlrs a barrel today. Traders said resistance continues overhead near 19.00 dlrs a barrel for May crude futures. Gasoline continued to post larger gains than heating oil and to trade at a premium to two oil futures. May gasoline was up 0.56 cent to 53.50 cts a gallon, at resistance. May heating oil was up 0.36 cent to 49.15 cts a gallon. Both contracts were off 0.05 cent from this morning's high. Reuter
EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS|European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said. "There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies," Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and monetary integration. "We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system," Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to "dedramatise" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul. REUTER

CAMBRIDGE BIOSCIENCE <CBCX> TO START AIDS TESTS|Cambridge BioScience Corp said it received Federal Drug Administration approval on its "Investigational New Drug" filing to begin human clinical trials of its second generation diagnostic test for AIDS. The company said it anticipates the test may be released to worldwide markets by late 1987 or early 1988. Cambridge BioScience also said it expects to file soon an "Investigational New Drug" with the FDA on its screening test for detecting AIDS antibodies. This test, which is being evaluated in emergency situations in several African nations, does not require highly trained technicians nor instrumentation, according to the company. Cambridge BioScience explained that the filing for human clinical trials for AIDS that received FDA approval, utilizes recombinant-DNA technology to detect and screen antibodies in blood or serum of patients infected with the AIDS-causing virus. The other separate planned filing with the FDA is a revolutionary, five-minute latex agglutination screening test for detecting AIDS antibodies, the company said. This test, utilizes latex beads coated with CBC's recombinant antigen which attract and hold AIDS antibodies, forming clusters (agglutination), which indicates a positive result. Reuter

ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE|State-owned engine maker <Rolls Royce Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed <Airbus Industrie> A340 aircraft. The company's so-called "pathfinder prospectus" gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered. Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit for 1987. Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings. Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards. BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion. The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971. When the government announced the sale, it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company. Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit rating to match those of its main competitors such as General Electric Co <GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's <UTX.N> Pratt and Whitney unit.

WHITE HOUSE DENIES ANY FURTHER ARMS SALES TO IRAN|The White House denied a report that the United States was continuing to ship arms or weapons-related equipment to Iran, but an administration official said there had been non-weapons sales to Tehran through commercial channels. "To the best of our knowledge, there have been no illegal sales from the forbidden munitions list," a White House spokesman said. The Defence Department also denied any military supplies had been sent to Iran since an administration ban late last year. NBC television, quoting U.S. And foreign intelligence sources, reported that the United States had been shipping weapons-related equipment to Iran as recently as last month. The administration official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters there had been commercial sales of products licensed by the Commerce Department, which maintains a list of products that can be exported without hurting national security. President Reagan banned arms shipments to Tehran after the Iran arms scandal broke last November. In January Secretary of State George Shultz told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee there would be "no more transfers of U.S.-origin military equipment to Iran, either directly or through third parties." The NBC report said the Pentagon was coordinating shipments of anti-aircraft command and control equipment used to direct fire of weapons systems. It said some shipments labelled "machine parts" had moved through Ostend, Belgium,on aircraft of the Santa Lucia Airways, which it identified as operated by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The CIA refused to comment. NBC said the equipment was flown to Pakistan and then on to Iran by Pakistani civilian and military aircraft. Later, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said: "We categorically deny that the United States is selling and/or sending any weapons to Iran." She added that Washington was "not doing anything in connection with the government of Iran which is not consistent with U.S. Laws or trade policy." Another administration official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the United States had licensed commercial sales of low-technology computer equipment to Iran, amounting to about 60 mln dlrs over the last three years.

OIL MARKET LIKELY TO REMAIN STABLE, SUBROTO SAYS|Indonesian Energy minister Subroto said he was very confident of continued stability in the oil market because of the determination of Opec members to maintain a price of 18 dlrs a barrel. "We are very confident that things will continue this way. The short-term outlook is favourable because of the resolution of Opec to stick to the 18 dlr price," he said at a signing ceremony for a new Indonesian production sharing agreement. He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its agreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels, and he expected prices to firm slightly in the third quarter of the year. He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June, members will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and seeing prices rise a bit, or raising the production ceiling so that members could produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LOWERS BENCHMARK PRIME|National Australia Bank Ltd <NABA.S> said it lowered its benchmark prime lending rate to 18.25 pct from 18.5, effective today, but left its base rate at 18.5. The benchmark reduction brings the rate into line with the prime rates of most of Australia's trading banks, including those of two of the other three major trading banks. However, the rate is above the 18 pct - the lowest ruling rate - set by the other major, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S>, on Friday and effective today. The benchmark is based on short-term interest rate movements while the base rate is tied to longer-term trends. REUTER

HUTTON <EFH> STILL INTERESTED IN PUROLATOR <PCC>|E.F. Hutton LBO Inc is still interested in an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp, and is examining the possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer, an E.F. Hutton spokesman said. Hutton's offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer from Emery Air Freight Corp <EAF> earlier this week. "We're definately not out of it at this point," the Hutton spokesman said. "We want to see what the offer is completely and understand it fully, and then fashion our response," the spokesman said. After Emery made its offer, Hutton extended the deadline on its offer to Monday. The offer was to have expired Wednesday. Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the offer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easier time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost savings by combining its business with those of Purolator. Purolator, a New Jersey-based overnight courier, has declined comment. Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price on speculation a new bidder would emerge. It was up 1/8 today at 40-3/8, above the Emery offer. Reuter
KENAI <KEN> SETS NOTE OFFER, AVOIDS CHAPTER 11|Kenai Corp said its shareholders approved of a reorganization to avoid a chapter 11 filing under the U.S. bankruptcy code. Shareholders approved an increase in authorized shares to two billion common and two mln preferred, with a par value of 0.001 dlrs per share. A portion of the new shares will be issued to holders of 57.5 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures, all of which are in default.

According to the exchange offer, each 1,000 dlrs principle of subordinated debentures will be exchanged for 1,000 shares of common stock, 500 dlrs principal of a variable interest subordinated debenture and 24 shares of convertible preferred stock, the company said. It said the offer will result in the issue of 57.5 mln common shares, 28.85 mln dlrs principle of variable rate subordinated debentures, and 1.38 mln shares of convertible preferred stock. The company said two holders of 29.9 mln dlrs of debentures who have already exchanged their holdings for 20.8 mln common shares and 23.5 mln dlrs principle amount of notes will resubmit the securities to meet the terms of the current exchange offer. It said the offer is dependent on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said that upon completion of the exchange offer, it may issue warrants to buy 100 mln shares of common stock to current shareholders and warrants for 75 mln shares to employees.

CENTRE-RIGHT WIN GERMANY'S HESSE STATE POLL|West Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their liberal Free Democrat Party (FDP) allies today won control of the central state of Hesse in state elections, toppling the Social Democrats (SPD) who had governed the state for over 40 years. The CDU/FDP coalition will have a two-seat majority over the SPD and their Greens party allies in the new state parliament. Earlier predictions forecast a hung parliament. The poll was the first major test of public opinion since national elections last January returned Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-dominated coalition to power in Bonn. Political commentators said the result was a debacle for the SPD, which has been split by disagreements over the party's future direction. It was also a rebuff for a unique coalition the SPD had formed in Hesse with the anti-nuclear Greens movement, which left-wing Social Democrats said could provide a model for a similar alliance at federal level. Bonn Environment Minister Walter Wallmann, the CDU's victorious candidate for the state premiership, told reporters "Many traditional SPD voters voted for us because they did not want an SPD that was under the influence of the Greens."

LME COPPER MIDSESSION FEATURES CASH PRICING|LME morning ring dealings in copper ended with three months Grade A business at 883 stg per tonne, up seven stg from yesterday's afternoon kerb close, equivalent to 1,417 dlrs per tonne, a rise of 11 dlrs. Morning ring dealings featured a wave of cash pricing purchases near the official close which established an indicated spread backwardation of 37 stg after earlier borrowing at a premium of 32 stg, unchanged from yesterday afternoon, traders said. Forward values extended pre-market gains, despite currency factors, with short covering and some chart support evident. Ring dealings also included options-linked borrowing interest from end April dates for one month at a backwardation of 23 stg. Analysts said the 870 stg area appears to have provided a minor chart support base, although upside potential remains limited against a background of routine physical demand and a buoyant U.K. Currency. On the pre-market, activity was mainly dollar-based and within the range 1,408 to 1,411 dlrs per tonne, traders said. Standard grade retained a spread backwardation of 10 stg but was tradeless.

BRITAIN WARNS JAPAN OVER TRADE ROW|British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable and Wireless Plc's <CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations. In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries. "I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world," Howard told reporters. "He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the message got home," he added. British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard said. Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan. "I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations," Howard said. "We simply aren't prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time." Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister. But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade. Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied. Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue. "There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations," he added, but gave no details. He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with. "But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time," he added. "What I've made plain is we expect to see action." Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices. Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms equal access to overseas financial markets. REUTER
DOLLAR STARTS EASIER IN LONDON, STERLING FIRM|The dollar opened easier after markets in the Far East had sold it down for yen, defeating new attempts by the Bank of Japan to check the yen's rise through sustained currency intervention, dealers said. But trading was slow and uninsipired and although dollar sentiment remained bearish, especially against the yen, dealers expected no major movements ahead of tomorrow's Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting. Sterling remained well bid as two new opinion polls showed that the ruling Conservative party had increased its strong lead, increasing the chances of an early election, they said. The dollar opened at 145.05/15 yen compared with 146.00/10 at yesterday's European close. It closed at 145.25 yen in Tokyo after New York's 145.85/90. The dollar opened at 1.8195/8205 marks after yesterday's close in Europe of 1.8245/55. It closed at 1.8205/15 in Tokyo after finishing at 1.8260/70 in New York. Sterling opened marginally weaker on its trade-weighted index, dropping one basis point to 72.3. But it started firmer at 1.6213/23 dlrs against 1.6163/73 last night. It was also firmer against the mark. The pound opened at 2.9540/9575 marks against 2.9490/9530 in Europe last night. But it lost some ground shortly after the opening, trading quietly around 2.95 marks. Dealers said that with uncertainty still surrounding the dollar, yen and mark, sterling looks strong and attractive on due to an apparent surge of support for the ruling Conservative party, relatively high interest rates and a strong economy. One opinion poll today showed the Conservatives had a 13-point lead over the opposition Labour party and a 17-point lead over the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance. Another forecast a 92 seat Conservative majority in a new parliament. One dealer reported a large sterling buying order from a Japanese institution earlier today. But dealers were cautious to push sterling much higher amid wariness of intervention by the Bank of England. The bank was thought to have intervened repeatedly yesterday but it was not sighted in the market today, dealers said. On the dollar, dealers said all eyes were turned to Washington where finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will meet tomorrow to review their February 22 Paris currency stabilisation pact. Few expect the meeting to produce more than a vaguely worded confirmation of the Paris goals of currency stability and increased economic cooperation. This outcome would almost certainly lead to renewed dollar weakness, especially against the yen, with levels around 140 yen well within reach, some dealers said. "But you never know. Perhaps the Japanese do come up with some sort of stimulation package that would satisfy the market after all," a dealer with a U.S. Bank said. He noted news that Japan was working out a reflationary supplementary 1987 budget. A senior official of the Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic Party said earlier today the party has drawn up the outline of a reflationary economic package including a 5,000 billion yen supplementary budget for fiscal 1987. The dollar opened at 1.5130/40 Swiss francs against 1.5180/90 in Europe. It opened at 6.0525/75 French francs, down from its European close of 6.0660/0710. REUTER

Leading industrialised countries should also step up concerted market intervention to stabilize exchange rates, Saito said. The measures will be presented to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone as a joint proposal of Keidanren, the Japan Federation of Employers' Association, the Japan Committee for Economic Development and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

ZAMBIAN CURRENCY FALLS AT FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION|The Zambian currency further depreciated yesterday at the second auction since the introduction of a two-tier foreign exchange system last month. The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at 16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week"s rate of 15 to the dollar. The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction, reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs. At the previous auction, the government offered eight mln dlrs. Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket of five currencies, for certain official transactions. It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auction only for parastatal organisations and the private sector, where the exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with market demand. The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive than the previous one, suspended in January after the central bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders. Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oil company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, is allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange on offer. REUTER

GERMAN CALL MONEY FIRMS ON TENDER|Call money firmed to about 3.65 pct, back to yesterday's 3.60/70 pct, from around 3.55 pct earlier today after the Bundesbank announced a tender for a new securities repurchase pact, dealers said. The Bundesbank offered funds over 28 days at 3.80 pct, unchanged from the rate on recent facilities. Many traders had expected the tender rate to come down in line with market rates for call money. When this did not happen, because of more than adequate liquidity, many participants decided to withdraw funds from the market and use them to build up minimum reserves further. This resulted in the slight rise in call money. Banks held 58.9 billion marks at the Bundesbank on April 5, averaging 59.3 billion over the first five days of the month, well clear of the likely 51 billion mark minimum reserve requirement, dealers said. There was therefore some surprise that the Bundesbank was offering more funds above the call money rate. But some dealers noted that the rate on the 28 day facility was in line with one month money, which traded at 3.80/85 today after 3.80/90 yesterday and 3.90/4.00 on April 1. Given market liquidity dealers said banks were likely to bid, and the Bundesbank allocate, less than the 14.9 billion marks draining from the market tomorrow when an earlier pact expires. One dealer expected some 10 billion marks to be allocated. Some dealers said the Bundesbank would have been unwilling to cut rates on this pact, as it is the first under its faster and more flexible tender process and because a lower rate might have been associated with the new system. Dealers said they still thought the Bundesbank would over the next month lower the call money range from the narrow 3.6-3.8 and broad 3.5-4.0 pct it has held recently. REUTER

VOLCKER URGES QUICK AID TO DEBTOR NATIONS|Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing. "There is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee. The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them, he said. Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power, but it is in a difficult position today, Volcker said. He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize Brazil's external payments. "The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian authorities," he said. Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to work together, Volcker said. Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations. In addition, the United States must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies, Volcker said. "We need time for those actions and the earlier depreciation to work their effects," he said. Reuter

U.S. CAR SALES RECOVER IN LATE MARCH|Sales of U.S.-built new cars surged during the last 10 days of March to the second highest levels of 1987, indicating car buying may have fully rebounded from its January slump. Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time in years, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers. For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakers sold 282,358 new cars, up 19.3 pct from late March 1986, giving the industry an annualized sales rate of 8.1 mln cars. That rate a year ago was 6.9 mln cars. "The last 10 days of March was the second strongest 10-day period we've had this year," said David Healy at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Reuter
DOLLAR OPENS LOWER IN QUIET ZURICH|The dollar opened slightly lower in quiet trading, with dealers holding back ahead of the outcome of this week's top-level international monetary talks in Washington. The dollar began here at 1.5128/5138 Swiss francs, down from the previous 1.5185/5195 close and the 1.5180/5190 francs in New York. However, dealers were sceptical that anything other than a mere reaffirmation of February's Paris Accord was likely to emerge from Washington. "The dollar is likely to stay stable or drift slowly down," predicted one dealer at a major U.S. Bank. The Swiss franc was also slightly higher against the other major currencies. Sterling began at 2.4526/4557 francs, down from the previous 2.4547/4578 francs close, while the mark slipped to 83.09/19 centimes from 83.11/21 centimes.

BRITAIN'S ECGD DISCUSSING NEW COVER FOR NIGERIA|Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is holding talks with Nigeria aimed at resuming insurance cover for British exporters to Nigeria, the head of ECGD's international debt division, Gerry Breach, said. The ECGD suspended cover on Nigeria in 1984 after the country fell into arrears on payments of insured and uninsured debts. Following last week's bilateral accord between Britain and Nigeria to reschedule the country's insured trade debts, bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption of cover. Breach told a businessmen's meeting that for the ECGD to consider "a gradual introduction of a package of new support" certain criteria would have to be met. This would involve the Nigerian economic structural adjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed by the International Monetary Fund, the program remaining on course and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and a satisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government of the ECGD insured short-term trade arrears. British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986. Reuter
INTERNATIONAL LPG PRICES MIXED|International LPG prices were mixed in the past week, with North Sea prices easier while prices in the Mediterranean and the Gulf were up in April, traders said. In the North Sea market, small cargoes of propane were sold as high as 126 dlrs per tonne on the f.o.b. basis early in the week, but prices eased after the majors posted their April contract prices, traders said. British Petroleum plc <BP> left propane unchanged at 110 dlrs and raised butane prices 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs, Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <ST> raised propane three dlrs to 113 and butane 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs, they said. In the Mediterranean, prices firm in Lavera as Algerian supplies were not always available. Spot propane was unchanged, while butane rose about 25 dlrs from last week, traders said. They said, however, the Mediterranean butane market was very thin, making it subject to wide price swings. In the Gulf, strong demand from the Far East pushed premium on small cargoes five to 10 dlrs above government selling price (gsp) for propane and 10 dlrs for butane, traders said. The rising premium over gsp, however, was partially offset by about 10 pct decline in shipping, making prices for propane about unchanged and butane five dlrs higher, basis c. and f.

PHILIPPINE COFFEE EXPORTS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY|Philippine coffee exports are expected to fall sharply due to a combination of the International Coffee Organisation's (ICO) decision not to revive export quotas and higher local prices, ICO Certifying Agency official Dante de Guzman told Reuters. He said exporter registrations dropped from an average weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exports in coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to total about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86. "Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices, it has become difficult to service exports," de Guzman said, adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude. Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending June from 1.1 mln bags last year, he said. REUTER

VW CURRENCY DEPARTMENT FORMER HEAD ARRESTED|The former chief of foreign exchange at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> has been arrested in connection with a scandal which may have cost the car maker a quarter of a billion dlrs, the chief state prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer said. He told Reuters that Burkhard "Bobby" Junger was arrested yesterday for suspected embezzlement. "There is reason to believe that Junger could have evaded justice, and investigating magistrates therefore asked for his arrest," Retemeyer said. VW fired Junger in March, after news emerged of the suspected foreign exchange swindle. In January the board gave him leave of absence. Six other people have been suspended. VW said last month computer programs were erased and documents faked in the possible fraud, in which it believes transactions meant to protect it against foreign currency losses were not completed. Retemeyer said, "We are still investigating a larger circle of people, among them Frankfurt currency dealers" He would not comment whether other arrests could be expected. The possible fraud resulted in a major management shake-up with the resignation of Rolf Selowsky, management board member in charge of finance, who assumed managerial responsibility for the affair. Retemeyer said last month he wanted to question Frankfurt-based money broker Joachim Schmidt, who may be able to give more details. Reuter

DENMARK PLANS TO END SALES TAX ON SOME ITEMS|The Danish government said it planned tax changes to discourage people making shopping trips to West Germany and other countries where consumer durables are cheaper. Tax Minister Isi Foighel told journalists the government will present a bill abolishing sales tax - generally 10 to 20 pct - on radios, record players, loudspeakers, video tapes, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens and small household items. The annual loss in revenue of 275 mln Danish crowns will be made up by higher duties on four-wheel drive vehicles and small pick-up vans, which will be taxed in future as commercial vehicles under two tonnes. Foighel also announced small reductions in the concessions for duty-free imports to compensate for a strengthening of the Danish crown. He said maximum concessions would apply in future only to travellers out of the country for more than 24 hours. Those returning within that period will have to prove to customs that they have been on more than a shopping trip. The tax move follows an official report showing that total border imports, about three billion crowns in 1985, rose by some 600 mln crowns in 1986, a trend which has alarmed Danish businesses, particularly in Jutland areas bordering Germany.

U.S. AID CHIEF TO BE NAMED TO TOP TREASURY POST|President Reagan will shortly nominate the head of the U.S. program for Third World development, Peter McPherson, as second-ranking officer of the Department of the Treasury, administration sources said. They said the White House was expected to announce McPherson's nomination to succeed Richard Darman as deputy Treasury scretary later this week. The nomination is subject to Senate approval. McPherson has headed the Agency for International Development (AID) since 1981.

WALL STREET STOCKS/MARION LABS <MKC>|Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rose sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday, traders and analysts said. The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987, ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago. That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company earned 70 cts a share. Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2. At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of 1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to cause even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low." Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of 90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year. Crossen said "because Marion is still just a small company, the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom line." He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share. "The company has a broad new product pipeline in the industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most innovative company in the business," he said. For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to have a growth rate of 55 pct. Reuter

UAE OIL PRODUCTION DROPS TEN PCT IN MARCH|Oil output in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05 mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customer resistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sources said. The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy Abu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a barrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72 dlrs. The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE producer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of 800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months. Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from around 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a mid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the sources added. Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif and Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed prices too high and cut liftings, the sources said. The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese term buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they added. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it Murban. Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on stream in 1983, to be test production not included in calculations for complying with the OPEC quota. Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its quota in March, the sources added. REUTER

LONDON MONEY MARKET CLOSES LITTLE CHANGED|Money market interest rates closed little changed after a quiet session as yesterday's talk of lower U.K. Base lending rates fizzled out, dealers said. Further opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party well ahead had little effect on the market with operators looking for more definite news on the political front. Sterling continued quietly steady ahead of the Group of Seven talks in Washington this week. One senior money broker commented, "What we want is an election date to put a stop to all the speculation. Once the market knows what's happening then we can move forward." The next move in U.K. Base rates, which now stand at 10 pct, is still expected to be down but uncertainty over the date of a general election is making for cautious trading, dealers said. Yesterday, opinion polls showing the Government was set to retain a substantial working majority lifted sterling and fuelled speculation about lower U.K. Interest rates. The British authorities are likely to remain cautious, however, as the G-7 finance ministers meeting is set to review their February Paris accord on currency stability. This could affect sterling which today was just one basis point lower in trade weighted terms to stand at 72.3. Dealers noted that longer dated paper again dominated the day-to-day dealings between the discount houses and the Bank of England. As rates fell yesterday, no band four bills, which have a maturity of between two and three months were transacted. Today, however, these again appeared but the majority of the Bank's assistance was provided in the one to two months range. The key one and three months interbank rates were unchanged quoted at 10-1/16 9-15/16 and 9-7/8 3/4 pct respectively. Until fresh economic or political news emerges, dealers say they expect the market to continue around these levels with only technical factors provoking small fluctuations in rates. The Bank of England forecast a 900 mln stg shortage in the system today but provided only 713 mln stg assistance. Despite this, overnight interbank traded in the 11 to 10 pct range having started the day at around 10-1/4 10 pct. Period interbank rates were little changed with six months quoted at 9-3/4 5/8 and one year at 9-5/8 1/2 pct. Sterling CDs were also mostly steady with six and nine months ending the day at 9-9/16 7/16 pct and 9-1/2 3/8 pct respectively. Eligible bank bill rates showed no change from late yesterday with one month at 9-13/16 25/32 pct and three months at 9-17/32 15/32 pct. REUTER

Spillover strength from higher cattle pits is also likely again today, they added. Reuter
U.S. NAVY SAID INCREASING PRESENCE NEAR GULF|Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in an effort to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to keep oil flowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported. The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three months longer than planned. The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time, as happens now, the paper said. The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz. It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq. U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted officials as saying. From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could fire long-range missiles, the paper said. REUTER

LONDON SOFT FUTURES ADOPT NEW CLEARING PROCEDURES|London's soft futures markets, namely cocoa, coffee and sugar, are adopting with immediate effect a uniform presentation on their respective open positions referring to previous day's trading figures, a spokeswoman for the London Commodity Exchange (LCE) said. The figures represent total clients' long positions as well as short positions, plus the net house positions as submitted by all members for each delivery month, she said. As a result, figures will differ from those previously published but are hoped to be more accurate and to compare more favourably with other international markets, she added. Since the introduction of a revised clearing procedure last October, which incorporated a system of "mark-to-market', figures as published bore little relationship to the true open position, the spokeswoman said. The open position for business done up to the previous trading day is prepared daily by the International Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) and then posted on the various market notice boards. REUTER

TOKYO BOND MARKET CLOSES SHARPLY HIGHER|The cash bond market closed higher in active trade led by securities houses' speculative buying and end-investor purchases of low coupon issues, triggered by declines in short-term interest rates, dealers said. The yield on the 5.1 pct 89th bond of 1996 closed at the low for the day of 3.905 pct against the 3.955 close yesterday, and the 3.930 opening. The 5.3 pct 95th bond of 1997 finished at 4.010 pct against 4.165 at yesterday's close and an opening today of 4.100. Active dealing accounts of city and trust banks heavily bought low coupon issues on the rate decline and in expectation of a further fall, dealers said. The lingering bearish outlook for the dollar is sustaining hopes of another drop in Japanese rates, regardless of what emerges from the expected meeting tomorrow of the G-7 meeting. The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 was 95.26-28 in late Tokyo trade against the 96.04-06 New York finish. In the absence of retail participation, the key bond eased on dealer position adjustments on the dollar's renewed weakness ahead of the expected meeting. However, some bankers said Japanese investors would return to the market, due to a wider Japan/U.S. Yield gap and demand for liquidity, but only if the dollar stabilizes. REUTER
CANADIAN BONDS CLOSE SLIGHTLY LOWER|Canadian bonds closed slightly lower on market jitters amplified by rumors that a big holder of domestic bonds was selling early in the day, dealers said. The market had opened 1/4 to 3/8 point stronger on news of unexpectedly weak U.S. employment data for March, but the advance sparked profit-taking which forced prices down about 1/4 point on the day. Rumors of a major seller were not confirmed but some traders felt limited potential for further Canadian dollar gains might be taking some of the shine off domestic bonds. The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 ended at 106-1/4 3/8 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 at 97-1/4 1/2. Reuter

SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES|The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers. "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination," the SEC said. Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days. Reuter

U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING|U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said. Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains, that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months. Until trends are clearer, "the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates," said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy. Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market, highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply. "The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur," Kaufman said. "Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer," said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Corp. However, Braverman said that, "from a longer term perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying opportunity." Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high. Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism. Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday. The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a similar "paroxysm of pessimism," the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance, however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points. Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely. Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months. Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall. "Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen since the start of the year," Held said. Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term. "The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance," said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion. The Lanston economists said, "The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar." Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift. However, economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming. There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged. This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday. There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987. Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen. REUTER
COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE|The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said. Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 "must buy" level. Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations, traders said. Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 SDR "must buy" level. The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday. Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and September, but these are set to change to July, September and December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot month, traders noted. The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market. But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the indicator which governs his activities, traders said. "The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa," an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said. Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln. A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes, traders said. In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the "must buy" level. But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market. The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action, dealers said. Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin. But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material. Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said. Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures. Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying, dealers said. "The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas," one trader said. Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were "all prognostication" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure. In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism. REUTER
CITIZENS FIRST BANCORP <CFB> RECEIVES FINE|Citizens First Bancorp Inc said its banking subsidiary pleaded guilty to two technical violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and was fined 2,000 dlrs.

DRUG COMPANIES GET OUT OF COSMETICS BUSINESSES|Several pharmaceutical companies, drawn in the 1970s to the fast growing cosmetics industry, are no longer finding it fashionable to sell makeup. "The fad right now is to purify and concentrate on the most attractive business. Right now that's the drug business," said David Saks, an analyst with Morgan, Olmstead. Yesterday, Eli Lilly and Co joined the ranks of other drug companies by choosing to sell off its lower growth Elizabeth Arden cosmetics business. "It's not that Elizabeth Arden is bad. To some it may be their pride and joy, but to Eli Lilly, it's a diversion of their management energies and financial resources from their gemstone, which is the drug business," Saks said. "Arden is a good company. I'm sure it's going to be a hot property. I'm sure people will be lining up to buy it," said Lynne Hyman, E.F. Hutton cosmetics analyst. Analysts said the Arden business could command about 600 mln dlrs, and likely buyers would be interested in its well-known name and distribution channels. Analysts said Avon Products Inc, a door-to-door makeup distributor, and the Japanese company Shiseido Co of Tokyo, might be willing buyers. An Avon spokesman said the company is interested in Arden, but it has not yet seen offering documents. Analysts said most of the changes of control in the cosmetics industry have been determined for the time being. "There's not much out there that hasn't changed hands or isn't relatively stable," said Hyman. Squibb <SQB> last year sold its Charles of the Ritz business to Yves Saint Laurent for 630 mln dlrs, and Beecham Plc said last month it was selling its Germain Monteil unit to Revlon Group <REV>. American Cyanamid <ACY>, a chemical and drug concern, is selling its Jacqueline Cochran Inc unit. One big cosmetics concern whose fate hasn't been sealed is Revlon Group Inc. The company received a takeover offer from McAndrews and Forbes, which is controlled by its chairman, Ronald Perelman. A major Revlon shareholder, McAndrews and Forbes, is offering 18.50 dlrs per share to take the company private. But Wall Street has been estimating values for the company of 20 dlrs per share and more. The stock was trading today at 20-7/8, off 1/2. Analysts said Revlon's cosmetics lines and name might be attractive to a corporate buyer, but they doubt one would jump into the situation one analyst described as a "can of worms." Analysts said drug companies are getting high prices for the cosmetics companies. They said buyers are attracted by strong brand names because of profit stability and prestige. REUTER...^M

Volume at the end of a 10 minute opening call was 85 lots. The modest fall was attributed to lack of follow-through to yesterday's mid-session rise with New York's similar downturn yesterday seen as an additional unsettling influence, they said.

FINANCE UNITS GAIN FROM PARENT COMPANY, SAYS S/P|Standard and Poor's said that currently 17 finance units benefit from parent relationships by receiving higher ratings than their financial performance alone would merit. By drawing on its parent company's strength, a weaker finance subsidiary can achieve a credit rating as high as its parent. An independent finance company on the other hand must operate within more stringent guidelines than a unit and is at a competitive disadvantage, S and P said. The agency rates a finance unit on its creditworthiness as well as the support agreement it has with its parent. Standard and Poor's said that some finance subsidiaries have formal support agreements with the parent company which obligate the parent to maintain the unit's net worth. The agreement assures that the unit meets its obligations on time and requires it to operate within specific guidelines. Others have less formal agreements with the parent like General Electric Credit Corp <GE> whose AAA rating reflects its parent's, General Electric Co. But GE injected sizeable equity into the unit at timely intervals, S and P noted. These agreements are being tested as finance firms expand, and S and P said it will review a unit that violates the pact. Reuter

ALGERIAN, SPANISH FIRMS AGREE QUICKSILVER PRICE|Algerian and Spanish producers which together meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs in quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300 dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said. The agreement was made during a meeting here last week between Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux et Substances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss the market situation. The two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted by some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the whole market since they take into account only part of the deals made," a statement by ENOF said. The result is that the prices quoted are far away from two firms' production costs. "They have thus decided that their selling price would not be linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications and that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob per jar, which is close to their production cost," the statement said. It added that Turkish producers would join in when the two firms meet again in Madrid later this month. The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchange hovered around 200 dlrs this week. REUTER

OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF FAMINE IN BANGLADESH|The failure of the Bangladesh government to tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to a famine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Khaleda Zia, told a press conference yesterday. Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the country in March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheat sales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said. Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-April will ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the arid north and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual at this time of the year," one official said. Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials and failure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Her remarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heat wave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in the south-west. Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000 tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two or three weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes of rice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. It revised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by 300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln. REUTER

STRONG QUAKE JOLTS CENTRAL JAPAN|A strong earthquake registering 6.9 on the open-ended Richter scale jolted central and northern Japan, the Meteorological Agency said, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. An agency statement estimated the epicentre of the quake, which struck at 0940 hrs (0040 GMT), as being under the sea off Fukushima prefecture, some 240 km north of Tokyo. On March 18, a quake also registering 6.9 on the Richter scale hit southwest Japan, killing two people. Earthquakes of force six on the Richter scale are capable of causing widespread, heavy damage in a populated area. The agency issued, but soon cancelled, a tidal-wave warning for the Pacific coastline of central and northern Japan. The Shinkansen bullet train linking Tokyo and northern Morioka stopped running. Services will be suspended for several hours while workers check the tracks, railway officials told Reuters. A spokesman for Fukushima police told Reuters they had not received any damage reports, even from the coastal town of Onahama, which registered the maximum intensity. He described the shaking as very strong. Reuter
AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO COUNTER-BIDS FOR TMOC|<The Australian Gas Light Co> (AGL) said it will offer one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in oil and gas producer <TMOC Resources Ltd> in a counter-bid to the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd <STOS.S>. The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price of 4.15. The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year, compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share. Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares. AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of 3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23. <Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share on-market offer that has since lapsed. AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid. AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue. It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses complementary with those of AGL. AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines. REUTER
WALL STREET STOCKS/COMPAQ COMPUTER <CPQ>|Compaq Computer Corp, IBM's chief rival in the personal computer market, scored a big gain on Wall Street today. Compaq's stock rose 1-3/8 to 32-1/4 on volume of 1.3 mln shares. "The rationale for the move," one trader said, "is that the damage from the IBM announcement yesterday was less than expected." He said Compaq's stock had been under pressure recently because of anticipation of IBM's unveiling of a new line of personal computers. International Business Machines <IBM> introduced four new personal computers and more than 100 new peripheral products. But analysts said the new computers, though they do contain a lot of proprietary concepts, will not be as hard to copy as some other PC makers had feared. "The long range issue here is who wins and who loses in the PC business, and that issue was not resolved yesterday and is unlikely to be decided any time soon," analyst Mark Stahlman of Sanford C. Bernstein and Co said. Stahlman reaffirmed his recommendation of Compaq and Apple Computer Inc <AAPL>. Stahlman said "The critical investment question now is who will have a pickup in sales in the near term. We expect to see a strong demand setting for PCs for the rest of this year, and that will boost the revenues for all of the major PC vendors." "The first quarter was the strongest PC sales period on record for Compaq, Apple and IBM," Stahlman said, "and I don't think the IBM announcement is going to change that trend soon." "In anticipating the IBM announcement, Compaq has made pricing adjustments necessary to compete for its immediate purposes," he said. Reuter
ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - FOREIGN BANKS IN GERMANY|Foreign banks in West Germany are reassessing their positions after a number of changes in the markets and the regulatory environment that have dampened a once-euphoric enthusiasm for expansion here. Banking sources said the most important changes were plans to bring securities holdings into capital lending ratios, the first such move in a major financial centre. This could place a serious burden on several foreign banks, particularly those active in primary and secondary bond markets. Foreign banks had much lower equity and reserve capital than most domestic banks. Senior banking sources said talks between the Bundesbank and the banking supervisory office over bringing securities -- primarily bonds -- under banking laws governing capital ratios were in progress. Although no date had been set for imposition, banks as early as this year may be obliged to bring bonds under 1985 rules that limit bank lending to 18 times shareholders equity and reserves. Although other national regulatory authorities are known to be considering similar steps in light of growing securitisation of debt previously in the balance sheet, Germany, with its tradition of prudence, may be the first. Brian Kissack, president of the Foreign Banks Association, told Reuters, "It's not a positive sign. It could cause certain people who are not in (West Germany) to query whether it was as attractive to get in now." Larger banks may begin to use global networks to pass on holdings in mark securities to other centres which had less stringent ratios, taking business out of the country, he added. But sources said foreign banks faced a host of other practical problems as well. These included, -- the apparent unwillingness of the Bonn government to make an early move to abolish the stock exchange turnover tax. -- signs that London's "Big Bang" may have deeper implications for German securities trading than first thought. -- difficulty in finding experienced securities professionals to staff new subsidiaries. -- growing pressure on commercial banking margins that is forcing widespread retrenchment and refocusing of activities. -- the threat of having to face a renewed push for market share by the largest and most powerful Japanese banks. By leaving the stock exchange turnover tax out of the initial negotiating session of the incoming federal coalition government, Bonn had dashed hopes it would soon be abolished. The tax is 0.25 pct on each side of a securities trade by a non-bank, but it is not levied on public authority bonds. This extra cost, particularly for finely-priced instruments such as floating rate notes, had kept much mark securities business firmly in the City, awaiting a change. But aside from this, London was more active than domestic houses had expected. Large U.S., British, Japanese and Swiss investors often preferred to execute block trades -- 50,000 shares and up -- with City market makers who could absorb at least some of the paper in their own positions, diminishing the immediate impact on the share price. Most German brokers and banks pass trades direct to the exchange floor, cutting profits or adding to costs. Bank in Liechstenstein (Frankfurt) GmbH board member Michael Zapf said London's share of German securities business done was causing foreign banks without German units to weigh whether establishment costs involved were worth the returns. Additional signs that London market makers may move into secondary level stocks had added to this concern, he said. Now, plans by many foreign banks to transfer mark securities trading entirely to newly established, mainly Frankfurt-based units were being reassessed, sources said. The continuing existence of the stock exchange tax had also effectively prevented the birth of a short-term mark paper market in certificates of deposit or commercial paper. Many U.S. Investment and money centre banks in particular were hoping experience in these would provide the lever to prise open tight credit relationships between companies and their domestic "house" banks. At the moment, U.S. Investment banks are expanding fastest here. A unit of Salomon Inc <SB.N> began last summer and Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS.N> is currently fitting out offices, probably for a summer start to business. A unit of <Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co> should begin operations toward year end. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER.N> and Shearson Lehman Brothers are known to be weighing conversion of current, small operations to full-standing units. But expansion had been hampered by the lack of experienced personnel in a hitherto fairly small market. The big three Swiss banks, which arrived between late 1985 and first half 1986, have been steadily building up securities departments, taking staff equally from domestic and foreign competitors. The two U.S. Banks longest established here, Citibank AG and Chase Bank AG, had been particularly hard hit. Both banks recently announced plans to cut back commercial activities and shut down German branch offices on orders from head office. In the competitive environment, return on assets employed was insufficient to meet requirements, sources said. But the weakening attraction of "Financial Centre Germany" was unlikely to deter major Japanese banks from setting up full subsidiaries when the Bundesbank gives the green light for mark eurobond lead management probably around third quarter 1987. Once banks such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd <DIKB.T> and Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> move in, competition for business, for staff and even for premises would soar, sources said. REUTER
U.S. CAR SALES RECOVER FROM JANUARY BLAHS|Sales of U.S.-built new cars surged during the last 10 days of March to the second highest levels of 1987, indicating that car buying may have fully rebounded from its January slump. Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time in years, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers. For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakers sold 282,358 new cars, up 19.3 pct from late March 1986, giving the industry an annualized sales rate of 8.1 mln cars. That rate a year ago was 6.9 mln cars. "The last 10 days of March was the second strongest 10-day period we've had this year," said David Healy at Drexel Burnham Lambert. "We've had a slow recovery since January, and these latest figures build on that. This lends some encouragement to the idea that we're looking at a pretty strong year," he said. In early February sales were up briefly to 8.3 mln units on an annual basis, before dropping again. Car buyers had rushed to dealer showrooms in December to take advantage of expiring tax deductions, taking away from normal January selling. But a slowly expanding economy, an exploding stock market and a growing array of incentives have lured customers to dealers' showrooms, analysts said. Ford Motor Co <F> sales jumped 29.5 pct in the period to 79,249 cars from 61,169 a year ago. For the month, the nation's second largest carmaker said sales increased 17.8 pct to 197,328 compared to 167,490. Chrysler Corp <C> reported a 20.2 pct sales jump to 40,454 compared with 33,669. In all of March it sold 96,649, up 6.3 pct from 90,945. Industry giant General Motors's sales rose a more modest 6.2 pct for late March to 140,522 verses 132,298 last year. But sales for the full month dropped 5.6 pct to 349,578 from 370,390. Also helping the U.S.-based industry, analysts said, is the slackening demand for imports, which suffered the first sales decline in memory. "Imports will need more and more sales incentives, a phenomenon unheard of two years ago," said Scott Merlis at Morgan Stanley. "Import prices have risen 17 pct on average, so they've become more sensitive to weaker demand in general." General Motors market share for the period fell to 48.2 pct, below the 51 pct for the first three months of the year and far below the 56 pct of most of last year. Ford's market share was 28.1 pct, up from 27.7 pct for the first three months, while Chrysler's share was 14.3 pct, a rise from 13.7 pct since the start of the year. Falling market share at General Motors apparently prompted the company to decide this week to close six plants for a week to bring supply into line with demand. But Ronald Glantz at Montgomery Securities said further production cuts might be necessary. "While GM has just taken 100,00 units out of second quarter production already because of weak sales, the continuation of this weakening market share suggests another production cutback is likely," Glantz said. Other carmakers with U.S plants posted these results during the March 21 to 31 period -- American Motors Corp <AMC> 1,198, down 50 pct, Volkswagen 2,145, down from 3,342, American Honda 16,635, up from 6,358, and Nissan 4,635, up from 2,536.

MANILA MEETING WITH DONORS ON LAND REFORM RESET|Philippine officials will meet major aid donors in May to discuss a 500 mln dlr funding for an extensive land reform program, Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said. He told a news conference he had planned to sit down with a consultative group of major donors led by the World Bank late this month in Tokyo but said the documentation of the project would not be ready until the end of this month. "The World Bank has recommended that we meet some time in the second half of May because it is pointless to have that meeting unless the participants have had adequate time to review the documentation," he said. Government officials said the progam, estimated to cost 36 billion pesos, aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land, including some 50,000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. The new plan will include not only rice and corn land but also sugar and coconut plantations. It is expected to benefit about three mln impoverished peasants. Ongpin said earlier there was strong interest in the program from donors but said given the substantial financial requirements of the plan, the government could not rely on only one source but on a combination of sources. President Corazon Aquino approved last month the use of an estimated 20 billion pesos from the proceeds of the sale of certain non-performing assets to private companies. Ongpin said he has asked Aquino to consider two other sources, namely the proceeds from the sale of government corporations which are to be privatised and proceeds from the liquidation of seized Marcos-related assets. He also said he would recommend public hearings before such a big project was legislated. "If we get a good reception in the public hearings, perhaps then the President might feel persuaded that it is not necessary to wait for the Congress," he said. Aquino had said she would prefer that legislation for the program be approved by a two-house Congress, whose members will be elected on May 11. But her advisers are trying to persuade her to implement the program before the Congress convenes in July. REUTER

FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY|The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed. The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March. The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings. At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets." The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, "the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions." In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data. One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken. The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge." The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit. Reuter

FCS LABORATORIES <FCSI> TERMINATES DEAL TALKS|FCS Laboratories Inc said merger discussions with an unnamed privately-held company in the health care field have ended without an agreement. The previously announced negotiations began last August, the company said. "It's disappointing to spend so much time on these negotiations and have them fail," said FCS chairman Nicholas Gallo III. "But the discussions could not produce a deal acceptable to our board in the context of the company's stronger financial position today as compared to six months ago." Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger partners, but will respond to serious inquiries. "We are determined to follow our plan to restore this company to profitability," he said. "To continue actively searching for potential acquirers inherently forces us to postpone the implementation of critical decisions which are part of the plan." The company, which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding, reaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987. Reuter

FRENCH TREASURY TO REPAY 680 MLN FRANCS OF DEBT|The French treasury has decided to repay 680 mln francs of debt issued before 1950, the Finance Ministry said. Seven issues, accounting for 0.13 pct of total state domestic debt, would be redeemed by the Caisse d Amortisement de la Dette Publique, the national debt amortisation fund, a Ministry statement said. The Ministry said the debt rationalisation exercise, similar to one carried out in 1958 and 1959, would take out of circulation old issues which were expensive to manage and difficult to trade because of their highly complex structure. Technical details of the operation would be announced in the next few days. The securities to be redeemed would be the three pct perpetual rente, five pct perpetual rente, four pct 1941-1960 redeemable rentes, 3.5 pct 1942-1952 redeemable rentes, three pct 1942-1955 redeemable rentes, three pct 1945-1954 redeemable rentes, and 4.5 pct 1933-1960 redeemable treasury bonds. The ministry said the operation would mainly benefit long-term holders of the issues, mainly small investors and small communes. The issues were difficult to trade because they comprised securities of variable nominal value, it noted. REUTER

UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION ON TOKYO TRIP|The U.K. Government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard, political sources said. Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit. Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. Firm's bid to win a significant role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources said. Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions. Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, government officials said. But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger, they added. Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger role in Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and Wireless Plc. The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for Japan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside competition. Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of attempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said "I am not sure it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of Mrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a personal interest in this problem. "I don't understand it to be closed at all." Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be "talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what they do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a very serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not as free as we allow access to our markets to be." He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britain could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance institutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similar treatment in financial markets in Japan soon. "I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will," Howard added. During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, the Trade Ministry, and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa. Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any significant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese telecommunications industry. Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined again today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war. This was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war. He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain believed a "sensible solution" could be found which would open Japanese markets to British goods. Government officials were at pains today to deny that Britain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise similar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financial firms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms. They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials had said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial institutions could be imposed from then but that this did not necessarily constitute a deadline. Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against Japanese banks, insurance and investment institutions. But despite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade elsewhere in Europe, Howard said he did not expect the move to backfire. He said in a radio interview today "it is true that we benefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose those advantages. And I am sure they are making their views plain to the Japanese government on this matter." Howard, who will also be visiting South Korea before returning to London on April 11, said his trip to Tokyo was planned well before the current trade row. Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also include ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global markets with Japanese officials. This would be done through a cooperation between national regulatory bodies. He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging information to combat financial fraud would be sought with Japan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between Britain and the United States.

WALL STREET STOCKS OUTLOOK|Stock prices may climb higher today, riding a two-day advance that saw the Dow Industrials climb 85 points, analysts said. But they cautioned that the market is due for a pause after such a strong climb and could move into a short term consolidation today as well. Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial average closed above the 2400 mark for the first time ever. Special situations, airlines and a strong bond market helped push the average up 15 points to end the day at 2406. Gainers led losers by seven-six on the Big Board, while volume slid slightly to 175 mln shares from 213 mln shares last Friday. "I think we'll get a day that will be, on balance, positive, but not any record setter," Thom Brown of Butcher and Singer said. Brown said that the market needs a pause before any stronger advance. "We need a bit of consolidation here," he said. "Eighty-five points is just too much, too soon." Brown added that the market probably will not pay much attention to the February consumer credit number being released today. "The market's been ignoring fundamentals," he said. "I don't see any problems with the Blue Chips easing higher today," Chris Callies of Dean Witter said. But she said the market may have some short term trouble in this 2400 area. "We're still in the midst of a correction" in the broad market, she said. "It's not entirely clear that this rally is the end of the two day correction that began last week." In the newspapers -- The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street said some people feel that when Mesa Limited Partnership provided badly needed assets to NRM Energy in exchange for a large stake in the company the move may have turned NRM into a T. Boone Pickens investment fund. The New York Times Market Place column said the first half hour of trading is becoming more important. That is the time when a large amount of important and growing investment from Japan and Europe enters the market. Indeed, the column said that a Salomon Brothers study shows that 44 pct of the market's total gain during the first two and a half months of this year came in the first half hour of trading. Reuter

PALM OIL OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING SHARPLY - OIL WORLD|Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said. The publication expects total Malaysian output during Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000 tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75 mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986. It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until 1988-90. Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said. Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June, while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept. Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three years, Oil World said without elaborating. Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in January 1986, Oil World said. West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop 500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes. Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however, are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago. Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival throughout May, it said. Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to 350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill Indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.

SYDNEY FINANCIAL FUTURES CLOSE MIXED|Exhausted buyers and a late fall on the Australian share market due to profit-taking led to a sharp drop in share price index contracts on the Sydney Futures Exchange, dealers said. Domestic credit futures were mixed, with 90-day bank bills firming in line with easier physical yields as the dollar rose, they said. Ten-year bond futures, however, were steady on the day's open in line with little changed physical yields. Comex-linked gold futures were higher on rises in bullion, while international credit futures were mixed in extremely thin trade. June share price index futures closed at 1735.5 from the day's 1754.0 open, well off yesterday's record 1748.5 close. September was also well down on 1737.0 from 1763.0 after finishing at 1746.0 yesterday. About 3,154 lots were traded. Dealers said the momentum of the futures market appeared to be exhausted, with a return to bigger discounts now likely. Demand for gold and industrial stock continued to drive up the all ordinaries index, which climbed 8.5 points to 1754.8, although this was well off the day's highs after late profit-taking. Easier physical yields, as a result of the firmer Australian dollar, also saw rises in 90-day bank bill futures. June contracts rose to 85.16 from the day's 85.00 open in active trade after falling to a low of 84.96. September rose to 85.25 from 85.12 after finishing yesterday at 85.20.

RUDING AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL, TRADE CURBS|Shifts in domestic economic policy, not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance Miniister H. Onno Ruding said. Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate the problems of heavily indebted developing countries. "The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country." "No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic economic and financial policies," Ruding said. Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord to stabilize foreign exchange rates. He said the highest priority should be given to policy changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget deficit and encouraging domestic savings. But he said other countries, such as Japan and West Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing their trade surpluses. Reuter

BOEING SEEKS CAUSE OF JAL ENGINE PROBLEM|Boeing Co. <BA> is trying to find out what caused an engine brace to snap on one of Japan Air Line's 747-SR jumbo jets, a spokesman for the airplane manufacturer said. "We know about the problem and we have provided a service advisory to operators of 747s," said the spokesman. "We are not advising any massive inspections at this time." The advisory alerts operators of the jumbo jets that a problem has occurred and under what circumstances, but it does not recommend any action. "A 'service bulletin' would be sent out if there is anything they should be concerned about," the spokesman said. A JAL spokesman in Toyko said inspectors making a routine check found one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine to the wing of a 747-SR had snapped due to metal fatigue. The airlines said it had ordered an inspection of all 11 of its 747-SR's. The plane is a full-sized jumbo jet that has been modified slightly to handle short-haul routes in Japan, mainly between Tokyo and Osaka. The jetliners have beefed-up landing gear to accommodate a higher-than-normal number of landings and takeoffs. Boeing's spokesman said only JAL and All Nippon Airlines use the 747-SR. JAL took delivery of its first 747-SR in 1973 and purchased two more last year. He said the braces had been shipped to a Boeing plant near Seattle where they were being inspected. Reuter

COLOMBIA'S MAIN OIL PIPELINE ATTACKED|State-run oil company Ecopetrol said Colombia's main oil pipeline was bombed again and pumping of 170,000 barrels per day was suspended. A spokeswoman for the company said that the early morning dynamite attack was the 31st in the last nine months on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which links Colombia's biggest oilfied at Cravo Norte to the Caribbean. She said about 2,000 barrels of crude were spilled and could not indicate when pumping would resume. The attack was near Magangue in northeastern Bolivar province. Ecopetrol is exploiting Cravo Norte in association with Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY> and Shell Petroleum N.V., a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <ST>. Ecopetrol said in a communique that bombings since last July led to a loss of more than 110,000 barrels of crude, or the equivalent of 10 mln dlrs. Reuter
EC INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GROWTH HALTS IN JANUARY|Industrial production in the European Community (EC) in January showed no growth compared with January 1986, the EC statistics office, Eurostat, said in a report. It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980, stood at 103.9 in both months. EC officials said while the lack of growth may have been due in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of the EC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend. Eurostat said for the last three months for which figures are known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared with the year-earlier period. Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about 1.8 pct, well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12 months ending last June, the office said. REUTER

STOCKS CLOSE AT RECORD HIGH IN HEAVY TOKYO TRADE|Share prices surged to close at a record high in heavy trade as record gains on Wall Street yesterday and expectations that Japan will take further steps to boost its economy drew investors into the market, brokers said. The market average climbed 198.54 to 22,784.65, a record closing high. The last closing record, set on April 4, was 22,738.67. Yesterday the market average lost 152.56. Advances led declines nine to eight in share turnover of 1.8 billion, the same as yesterday. Railway, securities house, rubber, oil, insurance, glass, fisheries, machinery and food stocks led the advance. Brokers said a meeting of the Group of Five industrial nations expected in Washington tomorrow is likely to lead to further undertakings by Japan to stimulate domestic demand. Gas, some manufacturing, shipbuilding and other shares related to the expansion of Japan's economy rose. A Nomura Securities broker said he did not expect another cut in Japan's discount rate around the time of tomorrow's talks but said the meeting would pressure Japan to import more in order to ward off a further yen rise against the dollar.

U.S. SCIENTISTS SAY TROPICAL OILS HEALTH RISK|U.S. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for labelling changes. The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers' labels. The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods. Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue. But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University, said, "Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid." He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the blood cholesterol level. "It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease," he said. A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans. Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E. David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on labelling. "What people really have to learn is to read labels," said Kritchevsky. "The more a consumer knows, the more likely he will make an intelligent choice." The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm, palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels. Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease." Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division, said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease. The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated. David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat. Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S. soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates. U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year earlier, according to Commerce Department figures. Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier. Reuter

Iraq said today it attacked Iran's Sirri Island as well as offshore oil escalations west of Kharg Island. Iran meanwhile reported victories on the southern front in its war with Iraq. These reports may support the market, which is "begging for news," said one broker. He said resistance is at 18.75-18.85 dlrs, then 19.00 dlrs a barrel for May crude.

LONDON COCOA STANDS HARDLY CHANGED AT MIDDAY|Cocoa futures stood hardly changed from last night at midday with near July last traded at yesterday's offered level of 1,318 stg from a 1,324 high, dealers said. Overnight steadiness in New York was balanced by firm sterling versus the dollar and continued availability of West African new crop physical offers, notably Ghana and Ivory. The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1,325 French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was offering around 1,460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar, dealers said. Volume midday was 1,013 lots including 130 crosses. Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in the near future, the only other bullish feature on the immediate horizon is the recently lower trade forecast for Bahia's temporao crop which ranged between 1.5 and 2.0 mln bags from 2.0 to 2.5 mln bags previously and compared with initial expectations of three mln bags, dealers said. Some traders are now saying the temporao is more likely to be near the lower end of the new range although this could be offset by a higher than expected Ivory Coast mid-crop. Resale physicals were quiet although light enquiry was seen, the dealers said. REUTER

BP SCOTTISH REFINERY SET TO RESTART THIS WEEK|The British Petroleum <BP.L> Co Plc's refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said. He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500 barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January, will not be completed before the end of April. He said the refinery had been closed for longer than originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being carried out prior to restarting. The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be out of operation for several months. The remainder of the refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was undamaged. He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing. In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13. REUTER
YEN BOND FUTURES CLOSE SHARPLY HIGHER|Yen bond futures prices closed sharply higher reflecting the steep advance in cash bond prices on purchases by end-investors and banks' dealing accounts, which was followed by broker buying, dealers said. Key June ended at 110.68 against the 109.93 finish yesterday after opening at 110.25 and rising to a high of 110.75. September ended at 109.40 against 108.74. Short-term rates dropped by one point in response to a seasonal surplus of some 400 billion yen, money traders said. City and trust bank dealing acounts actively bought low coupon cash issues, accelerating the futures rally, dealers said. Most currency dealers here believe the dollar will remain bearish despite the expected Group of Seven meeting in Washington tomorrow. Should the dollar fall further, Japan might have to ease its credit policy, which would lend support to the market, bond dealers said.

UNION TO PROTEST DART'S SUPERMARKETS <SGL> BID|The United Food And Commercial Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters protesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of Supermarkets General <SGL>. Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and also owns Rickels home centers. The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the current takeover mania." A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow our members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions." Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.

Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19. Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day repurchase pact maturing on April 28, they said. The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct one-month, and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount rates today. Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to government tax allocations to local governments and public entities. The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about 4,300 billion yen, they said. REUTER
DOLLAR OPENS EASIER IN QUIET FRANKFURT|The dollar opened easier in quiet trading and should stay firmly entrenched in its established range ahead of this week's round of international finance meetings, dealers said. "There is little turnover, no new ideas or impulses," a dealer at a U.S. Bank said. "It promises to be a boring day." He said the dollar's range was expected to be 1.8075 to 1.8250 marks in the run-up to the International Monetary Fund forum. The mark eased against some currencies on speculation call money rates could fall further. Despite this, the dollar opened lower at 1.8200/15 marks after yesterday's 1.8260/70. The Bundesbank is due to announce a securities repurchase tender today. Money market dealers said funds may be allocated at lower than the 3.80 pct the bank has set since its monetary package at the end of January, softening the mark's undertone. Sterling opened at 2.951/955 marks, just under yesterday's closing 2.954/958, and was seen firming further against major currencies on a wave of popularity for British prime minsiter Margaret Thatcher's ruling Conservatives. "Sterling is looking very healthy at the moment," one dealer said, adding that Japanese security houses bought pounds at the start of trading. Dealers said the pound was also supported by an improved British economic outlook and stability in the oil market. The Swiss franc continued to firm against the mark as investors took advantage of the interest rate differential. It opened higher at 120.25/40 marks per 100 after yesterday's last 120.10/25. The yen strengthened to open at 1.2520/2540 marks per 100 from yesterday's last 1.2490/2510 and the French franc was unchanged at yesterday's last 30.04/07 marks per 100. The Belgian franc was stable at 4.828/830 marks per 100. The Danish crown started at 26.48/51 marks per 100, little changed from yesterday's closing 26.49/51. Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from late yesterday, with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-9/16 pct. Six-month euromarks were stable at midpoint 3-7/8 pct. REUTER

STOCKS CLOSE WEAKER IN HONG KONG|Share prices closed weaker but well above their lows on late bargain hunting in fairly quiet trading, brokers said. The Hang Seng Index lost 15.29 points to end the day at 2,664.70 after falling more than 40 points in late morning. The Hong Kong Index shed 10.69 to 1,713.81. Turnover was 657.5 mln H.K.

LONDON EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS STEADY AT MIDSESSION|Eurodollar deposit rates were little changed at midsession though some firmness was detected at the longer end of the market prompted by a slightly weaker dollar.

LONDON COCOA HOLDS LITTLE CHANGED AT MIDMORNING|Cocoa futures were about unchanged from last night by midmorning with near July trading at 1,319 stg from 1,318 asked and a 1,324/1,318 high-low. Sterling's strength together with continued availability of West African new crop physical offerings more than outweighed any bullish impact from last night's higher New York market. Dealers said the market had been forecast to open as much as 10 stg up, basis New York's close. The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1,325 French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was there at around 1,460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar, they said. Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in the near future, the only other bullish feature is the lower trade forecast for Bahia's temporao crop which was recently reduced to 1.5/2.0 mln bags from 2.0/2.5 previously and compared with initial expectations of up to three mln bags. Dealers said trade ideas are now pointing to the lower end of the new forecast range although in terms of world production this may well be evened out by a better than expected Ivory Coast mid-crop.

PERU SAYS IT INTENDS TO DEEPEN DEBT STANCE|President Alan Garcia said he sought to deepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by limiting repayments to the World Bank. In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans. "We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt," he said. Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. But tonight Garcia said: "We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us." The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr debt. Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year. He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln. Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements. He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1, 1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year. He did not say when this increase would be effective. Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue earner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes. Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up, he said, without specifying the amount. Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct premium above the market exchange rate. The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is 14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80. To encourage private investment, he said the government would set up a special fund with which it would match every two intis of private investment with one inti from the government. He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday strengthened the democratic authority of his government. REUTER

DOLLAR STEADY NEAR LOWS AT LONDON MIDSESSION|The dollar was steady near lower opening levels in extremely quiet trading and dealers did not expect the U.S. Currency to move significantly before the series of high-level monetary meetings starting today in Washington. Sterling trading was equally quiet. Bullishness on the back of two new opinion polls suggesting Britain's ruling Conservative party had increased its lead over the opposition was checked by fears of fresh sterling-selling intervention by the Bank of England, dealers said. The dollar fetched 1.8215/25 marks at midsession against 1.8195/8205 at the opening and 1.8245/55 in Europe last night. The dollar was quoted at 145.10/20 yen, virtually unchanged from its opening 145.05/15 but sharply below yesterday's European closing 146.00/10. It briefly dipped below 145 yen, to a quoted low of 144.85, but recovered later to trade quietly around opening levels, dealers said. Trade-weighted, sterling stood at 72.3 pct of its 1975 value, unchanged form the opening but one basis point below yesterday's close. The pound fetched 2.9480/9520 marks and 1.6190/6200 dlrs at midsession after its opening 2.9540/75 and 1.6213/23, and yesterday's closing 2.9490/9530 and 1.6163/73. Dealers said dollar business had virtually halted in Europe after a large selloff against the yen in the Far East, which sustained Bank of Japan intervention failed to stem earlier today. They said that in the absence of other factors, participants awaited the outcome of the informal talks of Group of Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washington today, and Group of Seven monetary talks tomorrow. Most dealers expected the meetings to produce little more than a vaguely worded statement to reaffirm shared objectives of stable currency markets and economic policy coordination. The Group of Five and Canada agreed in Paris on February 22 to call a halt to the dollar's sharp decline, and several participant central banks have since intervened to keep currencies within narrow ranges against each other. But a flare-up of the long-standing trade frictions between the U.S. And Japan last month encouraged markets to test the agreement, pushing the dollar sharply lower against the yen. Dealers said that short of a convincing undertaking by Japan at the Washington talks to step up efforts to reduce trade surpluses and stimulate domestic demand, the dollar would resume its fall, especially against the yen. Without agreement on the trade issue, the dollar appears set to test support levels at 143 yen in the very short term, with 140 yen within reach over the next few weeks, dealers said. Some dealers said Japan appears ready to compromise with the U.S. On economic policy issues. Expectations were rising of a further half-point cut in the Japanese discount rate and Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party today announced an outline agreement on economic reflation which includes a 5,000 billion yen additional budget for 1987, the dealers said. Some dealers said the market could get some impetus from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker when he testifies on Third World debt problems before the Senate banking committee later today. Dealers said sterling remained firm amid growing confidence the ruling Conservative party is assured of victory in an election which they said would likely be called for June. One poll out today showed the Conservatives leading with 43 pct support against Labour's 30 pct and the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance at 26 pct. Another poll forecast a Conserative majority of 92 seats in a new parliament. But wariness of Bank of England sterling-selling intervention made participants cautious about pushing the pound much higher, dealers said. Some dealers said the Bank of England was believed to have intervened on a small scale yesterday but others said they had not detected such action. No polled dealer said he had sighted Bank intervention today. The dollar was quoted at 1.5110/20 Swiss francs at midsession against 1.5130/40 at the opening and a 1.5180/90 European close. It fetched 6.0575/0625 French francs against 6.0525/75 at the opening and 6.0660/0710 at close. REUTER

U.S., JAPANESE OPEN TALKS ON SEMICONDUCTORS|U.S. and Japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports. But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17. The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties would be retroactive to March 31. Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.

BALDRIGE SEES NO TRADE WAR WITH JAPAN|U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the dispute between the U.S. And Japan over computer chips will not develop into a full-scale trade war. "I think both sides will try and make sure that this doesn't start a trade war -- as a matter of fact I'm positive that there won't be a trade war with Japan," Baldrige said in a television interview. President Reagan last week imposed penalties over Japan's alleged failure to adhere to a July 1986 agreement to stop selling semiconductors in third countries at below cost and to open its own market to U.S.-made chips. Despite Tokyo's displeasure with the penalties, Baldrige said Japan would refrain from taking retaliatory steps that would lead to a trade war, largely because Japan itself would have the most to lose in such a conflict. "Japan, I think will -- because they have the means to do it -- face up to the fact that as the second largest industrial trading power in the world they have to live up to their responsibilities of free trade," he said. "I think we'll work our way out of this," he added. "It's not going to be easy. But I guarantee you, we're not going to have a trade war." REUTER
CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD|World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world. But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war. Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth. "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time," he said. He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy." The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched. He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform. The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy. "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio," Conable said. He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time. He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt." Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank. Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks. He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency. the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities. "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow," Conable said. However, he said "I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose." He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis. Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues. On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development." He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution." On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa. Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings. Reuter
IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND|Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels per day, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said. Reuter

TIME <TL> SEES DILUTION FROM SCOTT, FORESMAN|Time Inc said the acquisition of Scott, Foresman and Co last year will dilute earnings per share by about 17 cts a share for the full year in 1987. For the first quarter the acquisition will have a negative impact of about 20 cts per share, chief financial officer Thayer Bigelow told security analysts. He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before depreciation and amortization for the full year. N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said Soctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987. Bigelow said the textbook business, which normally has its highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the first quarter, will have an "adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs' on book publishing income for the first quarter. "First quarter performance for the rest of Time Inc will be better than last year," Bigelow said. The dilution of 17 cts per share for 1987 includes the effects of financing the acquisition. Bigelow also said the company is "comfortable" with estimates that earnings will be between 3.75 dlrs and 4.25 dlrs per share for the year. Reuter

MORE RAIN IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES|The National Weather Service said a storm, centered off the east of Massachusetts early this morning, continued to produce rain across New England, and as far west as Michigan, Ohio and west Virginia. Some areas in the northeastern U.S. have yet to see the sun this month. A flood warning remains in effect for small rivers in southern New Hampshire and extreme southwestern Maine. A flood warning is also in effect for interior Rhode Island, and central and northeastern Massachusetts. A flood watch covers much of the rest of Massachusetts, eastern interior Connecticut and coastal Rhode Island, along with the southern half of Vermont, the White mountains of New Hampshire and much of southern Maine. The storm off the Atlantic Coast has been very slow to move out to sea, and rain is likely to continue in northern New England into Wednesday. Cool and wet weather has also prevailed in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas so far this month. A few light rainshowers were over the lower Rio Grande Valley early this morning. Rainshowers were also widely scattered over the middle Mississippi Valley. A cold front was bringing cloudy skies and scattered rainshowers to the northwestern U.S. Skies remained clear in the north central U.S. Unseasonably warm temperatures prevailed across the north central states Monday afternoon. High temperatures in northern Minnesota were warmer than those in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Temperatures were in the 30s F early this morning in the central and southern Rockies, and the southern and central high Plains.

Recent increased roaster demand and physical offtake of coffee prompted light general buying, dealers said. However, some analysts believed prices should be weakening due to the increase in Colombian, Brazilian and Mexican coffee on the market after origin sales of the past week.

JAPAN RULING PARTY SEEKS BIG SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET|The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a senior party official said. It also urged the government to concentrate in the first half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record proportion of the year's public works spending, he said. The LDP also suggested the government review the ceiling on budgetary requests for investment in public works projects presented by individual ministries, he added. But the LDP official said the government should not abandon its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990. These measures should be treated as an emergency, partly because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external trade imbalance with the U.S., He said. The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. This week when Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting, he added. The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's Chairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposed supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than August but before November. The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29 for talks with President Reagan, Ito said. The full government-endorsed economic package is expected to be announced in late May. The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88 half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previous record for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87. Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks. An LDP statement said the government should use the additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise. REUTER

TREASURY'S BAKER TO HOLD TALKS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH|U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker holds talks with counterparts from Europe and Japan today, to urge them to carry out commitments in a recent accord to speed their economic growth. Baker is also expected to outline proposals for making agreements to coordinate economic policies more binding. The bilateral discussions foreshadow full-blown talks of the Group of Five industrial countries joined later by Italy and Canada to form the Group of Seven. The five comprise finance ministers and central bankers of the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain. The Treasury Secretary is expected to see Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Baker and other finance ministers say they intend to reaffirm the Paris Agreement to buttress global economic growth, reduce trade imbalances and stabilize currencies. Monetary sources said a short communique to that effect is expected after the meeting ends. These talks form part of this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the same time, monetary sources say they expect Baker to put forward proposals, originally outlined at the 1986 Tokyo Summit, to tighten procedures for policy coordination. Washington wants other major nations to establish specific policy goals for economic growth, inflation, current account balance of payments, trade balances, budget performance, monetary conditions and currencies. If actual economic performance veers sharply away from such objectives, then countries should consult on whether corrective action is necessary, the proposal says. Monetary sources said there was some support for the proposal, which may not be made final until the Venice Economic Summit in June, but Britain and West Germany were firmly against any attempt to make corrective action automatic. The U.S. Treasury team, led by Baker, has worked on this plan since last September, when it won the support of France. Baker, meanwhile, will press Japan and West Germany to live up to their commitments, made over six weeks ago in Paris, to boost their domestic demand to absorb more imports. He is also expected to reassure his counterparts that the Reagan administration will reach agreement with Congress on a significant budget deficit cut this year, helping to depress U.S. demand for imports. The aim of the Paris Accord is to redress the huge imbalance between the trade surpluses of Tokyo and Bonn on the one hand, and Washington's massive trade deficit on the other. Japan, in particular, is under pressure to come up with a meaningful stimulus package or face a further rise in the yen. Financial markets appear to believe the yen should go higher against the dollar, a development that has become unacceptable in Japan. The Paris Agreement, by the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada, called for currencies to be stabilized around current levels. But the dollar fell again just several weeks after the agreement was reached, and its present stability is said to be temporary as dealers await the outcome of this week's talks. Meanwhile, representatives of the leading Third World countries continue preparing their position for their ministers to present to industrial nations later this week. Monetary sources said the so-called Group of 24 developing nations are preparing a very tough communique which brands the western strategy for shoring up the debt strategy as a failure. They call instead for vast new assistance from the industrial world and a much greater role for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Reuter

INSTITUTE SEES W.GERMAN OUTPUT FALL IN 1987|Production in the manufactured goods industry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline by between one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in 1986, the Ifo economic institute said. An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affecting the engineering industry particularly. It saw a decline of two to three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986. Orders, especially from abroad, were also falling sharply for capital goods in the electronics sector, it added. Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in 1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose 5.1 pct. Chemical industry production, which fell by 0.9 pct last year, was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987. This sector suffered from slack demand from abroad and from low domestic consumption. REUTER

U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - NARROW RANGES|After a few days of volatility, the credit markets show signs of settling back into the frustratingly narrow ranges that prevailed for much of the first quarter, economists said. Friday's weak employment data for March braked an ascent in bond yields before the 30-year yield could reach the psychologically important eight pct level. But, with question marks hanging over the strength of the economy and, more critically, the value of the dollar, economists said the market remains fragile and will not quickly recoup the ground lost in the past two weeks. The 30-year bond yield closed Monday at 7.84 pct, down from 7.86 pct on Friday and a 12-month high last week of 7.93 pct, but trading was lackluster. "People are sitting on the fence, they don't really know what to do," said Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "Our retail accounts are not committing themselves either way." No economic indicators are due today, but the markets will hear Congressional testimony from Fed chairman Paul Volcker at 1000 EDT (1400 GMT) and will be alert for the possibility of another outright purchase of securities by the Fed. The Fed needs to buy a large volume of securities at this time of year to offset the reserve drain caused by a build-up of Treasury funds at the Fed around the April 15 tax date. The Fed confounded most economists' predictions of a bill "pass" last week by buying instead a record 2.2 billion dlrs of notes and bonds, and Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the Fed could make it two in a row by offering to buy coupon securities today or Wednesday. The Fed will not buy bills since they are already in relatively short supply after heavy Treasury paydowns in recent weeks, she argued. "They haven't paid down so many bills before in a quarter," Ramirez said, noting that the Treasury has been able to reduce the size of its regular bill auctions because of strong tax revenues following the reform of the tax code at the beginning of the year. Because it would be unprecedented for the Fed to conduct back-to-back coupon "passes", most economists still expect the Fed to buy bills this week instead of bonds and notes. After trading late yesterday at 6-1/8 pct, Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open at 6-1/8, 6-1/4 pct. Reuter
